  viral infection, reproduction and mutation","  Eigen's quasi-species model describes viruses as ensembles of different
mutants of a high fitness ""master"" genotype. Mutants are assumed to have lower
fitness than the master type, yet they coexist with it forming the
quasi-species. When the mutation rate is sufficiently high, the master type no
longer survives and gets replaced by a wide range of mutant types, thus
destroying the quasi-species. It is the so-called ""error catastrophe"". But
natural selection acts on phenotypes, not genotypes, and huge amounts of
genotypes yield the same phenotype. An important consequence of this is the
appearance of beneficial mutations which increase the fitness of mutants. A
model has been recently proposed to describe quasi-species in the presence of
beneficial mutations. This model lacks the error catastrophe of Eigen's model
and predicts a steady state in which the viral population grows exponentially.
Extinction can only occur if the infectivity of the quasi-species is so low
that this exponential is negative. In this work I investigate the transient of
this model when infection is started from a small amount of low fitness
virions. I prove that, beyond an initial regime where viral population
decreases (and can go extinct), the growth of the population is
super-exponential. Hence this population quickly becomes so huge that selection
due to lack of host cells to be infected begins to act before the steady state
is reached. This result suggests that viral infection may widespread before the
virus has developed its optimal form.

We perform simulations which predict that monolayer membranes are

  systems","  Particle and ensemble filters are increasingly utilized for inference,
optimization, and forecast; however, both filtering methods use discrete
distributions to simulate continuous state space, a drawback that can lead to
degraded performance for non-linear dynamical systems. Here we propose a simple
modification, applicable to both particle and ensemble filters, that
compensates for this problem. The method randomly replaces one or more model
variables or parameters within a fraction of simulated trajectories at each
filtering cycle. This modification, termed space re-probing, expands the state
space covered by the filter through the introduction of outlying trajectories.
We apply the space re-probing modification to three particle filters and three
ensemble filters, and use these modified filters to model and forecast
influenza epidemics. For both filter types, the space re-probing improves
simulation of influenza epidemic curves and the prediction of influenza
outbreak peak timing. Further, as fewer particles are needed for the particle
filters, the proposed modification reduces the computational cost of these
filters.

  risk factors for dengue during an outbreak in Machala, Ecuador, in 2010","  The objective of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics
and climatic and social-ecological risk factors associated with the largest
dengue epidemic to date in Machala, Ecuador, to inform the development of a
dengue EWS. The following data were included in analyses: neighborhood-level
georeferenced dengue cases, national census data, and entomological
surveillance data from 2010; time series of weekly dengue cases (aggregated to
the city-level) and meteorological data from 2003 to 2012. We applied LISA and
Morans I to analyze the spatial distribution of the 2010 dengue cases, and
developed multivariate logistic regression models through a multi-model
selection process to identify census variables and entomological covariates
associated with the presence of dengue at the neighborhood level. Using data
aggregated at the city-level, we conducted a time-series (wavelet) analysis of
weekly climate and dengue incidence (2003-2012) to identify significant time
periods (e.g., annual, biannual) when climate co-varied with dengue, and to
describe the climate conditions associated with the 2010 outbreak. We found
significant hotspots of dengue transmission near the center of Machala. The
best-fit model to predict the presence of dengue included older age and female
gender of the head of the household, greater access to piped water in the home,
poor housing condition, and less distance to the central hospital. Wavelet
analyses revealed that dengue transmission co-varied with rainfall and minimum
temperature at annual and biannual cycles, and we found that anomalously high
rainfall and temperatures were associated with the 2010 outbreak. Our findings
highlight the importance of geospatial information in dengue surveillance and
the potential to develop a climate-driven spatiotemporal prediction models to
inform disease prevention and control interventions.

1410.8564v1,2014-10-30 21:29:17,2014-10-30 21:29:17,Ebola cases and health system demand in Liberia,"  In 2014, a major epidemic of human Ebola virus disease emerged in West
Africa, where human-to-human transmission has now been been sustained for
greater than 10 months. In the summer of 2014, there was great uncertainty
about the answers to several key policy questions concerning the path to
containment. In recent years, epidemic models have been used to guide public
health interventions. But, model-based policy relies on high quality causal
understanding of transmission, including the availability of appropriate
dynamic transmission models and reliable reporting about the sequence of case
incidence for model fitting, which were lacking for this epidemic. To
investigate the range of potential transmission scenarios, we developed a
multi-type branching process model that incorporates key heterogeneities and
time-varying parameters to reflect changing human behavior and deliberate
interventions. Ensembles of this model were evaluated at a set of parameters
that were both epidemiologically plausible and capable of reproducing the
observed trajectory. Results suggest that epidemic outcome depends on both
hospital capacity and individual behavior. The model predicts that if hospital
capacity is not increased soon, then transmission may outpace the rate of
isolation and the ability to provide care for the ill, infectious, and dying.
Similarly, containment will probably require individuals to adopt behaviors
that increase the rates of case identification and isolation and secure burial
of the deceased. Given current knowledge, it is uncertain that this epidemic
will be contained even with 99% hospitalization rate at the currently projected
hospital capacity.

cluster can exist in a network. We introduce sausage-like networks (SLNs), an
ensemble of synthetic modular networks in which more than one percolating
cluster can appear. We show that coexisting percolating clusters (CPCs) emerge
in such networks due to limited mixing, i.e., a small number of interlinks
between pairs of modules. We develop an approach called modular message passing
(MMP) to describe and verify these observations. We demonstrate that the
appearance of CPCs is an important source of inaccuracy in the previously
introduced percolation theories, such as the message passing (MP) approach.
Moreover, we show that the MMP theory improves significantly over the
predictions of MP for percolation on synthetic networks with limited mixing and
also on several real-world networks. These findings have important implications
for understanding the robustness of networks and in quantifying epidemic
outbreaks in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease spread.

  and subgraph family: Higher-order structure matters","  Designing algorithms that generate networks with a given degree sequence
while varying both subgraph composition and distribution of subgraphs around
nodes is an important but challenging research problem. Current algorithms lack
control of key network parameters, the ability to specify to what subgraphs a
node belongs to, come at a considerable complexity cost or, critically, sample
from a limited ensemble of networks. To enable controlled investigations of the
impact and role of subgraphs, especially for epidemics, neuronal activity or
complex contagion, it is essential that the generation process be versatile and
the generated networks as diverse as possible. In this paper, we present two
new network generation algorithms that use subgraphs as building blocks to
construct networks preserving a given degree sequence. Additionally, these
algorithms provide control over clustering both at node and global level. In
both cases, we show that, despite being constrained by a degree sequence and
global clustering, generated networks have markedly different topologies as
evidenced by both subgraph prevalence and distribution around nodes, and
large-scale network structure metrics such as path length and betweenness
measures. Simulations of standard epidemic and complex contagion models on
those networks reveal that degree distribution and global clustering do not
always accurately predict the outcome of dynamical processes taking place on
them. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of both methods.

  Capsid Assembly","  Most of the existing research in assembly pathway prediction/analysis of
virus cap- sids makes the simplifying assumption that the configuration of the
intermediate states can be extracted directly from the final configuration of
the entire capsid. This assump- tion does not take into account the
conformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to
the binding interfaces that continues throughout the assembly process until
stabilization. This paper presents a statistical-ensemble based approach which
provides sufficient samples of the configurational space for each monomer and
the relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties
in their binding and conformations. Furthermore, instead of using larger
capsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible
sub-assemblies to bind in all pos- sible combinations. We represent this
assembly graph in two different ways. First, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank
measure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the
sampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical
equilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both
associations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the
binding free energies. Results from both of these experiments showed
significant departure from those one would obtain if only the static
configurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the
importance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and provide a
statistical framework as an important first step towards assembly pathway
prediction with high statistical confidence.

under study (e.g., a virus). When the object is heterogeneous but has an
overall symmetry, it is natural to describe the object as stochastic with
symmetrical statistics. This paper presents a maximum likelihood reconstruction
approach which allows each object to lack symmetry while constraining the {\it
statistics} of the ensemble of objects to have symmetry. This algorithm is
demonstrated on bacteriophage HK97 and is contrasted with an existing algorithm
in which each object, while still heterogeneous, has the symmetry.
Reconstruction results show that the proposed algorithm eliminates
long-standing distortions in previous heterogeneity calculations associated
with symmetry axes, and provides estimates that make more biologically sense
than the estimates of existing algorithms.

  Process stacked generalisation","  Maps of infectious disease---charting spatial variations in the force of
infection, degree of endemicity, and the burden on human health---provide an
essential evidence base to support planning towards global health targets.
Contemporary disease mapping efforts have embraced statistical modelling
approaches to properly acknowledge uncertainties in both the available
measurements and their spatial interpolation. The most common such approach is
that of Gaussian process regression, a mathematical framework comprised of two
components: a mean function harnessing the predictive power of multiple
independent variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal
shrinkage against residual variation from the mean. Though many techniques have
been developed to improve the flexibility and fitting of the covariance
function, models for the mean function have typically been restricted to simple
linear terms. For infectious diseases, known to be driven by complex
interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors, improved
modelling of the mean function can greatly boost predictive power. Here we
present an ensemble approach based on stacked generalisation that allows for
multiple, non-linear algorithmic mean functions to be jointly embedded within
the Gaussian process framework. We apply this method to mapping Plasmodium
falciparum prevalence data in Sub-Saharan Africa and show that the generalised
ensemble approach markedly out-performs any individual method.

  ensembles","  Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be
valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or
prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for
this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for
prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies;
some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points
within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single
prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of
ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest
as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the
simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most
complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the
season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty,
and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to
predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States,
both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We
trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 -
2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in
the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods
showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component
models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the
component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable

that an ensemble of recurrent neural networks are able to predict whether an
executable is malicious or benign within the first 5 seconds of execution with
94% accuracy. This is the first time general types of malicious file have been
predicted to be malicious during execution rather than using a complete

  vaccination impact during an Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Eastern
  region of the Democratic Republic of Congo","  As of October 12, 2018, 211 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported
in North Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of
October the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed
conflict is occurring, and in which EVD cases and their contacts are difficult
for health workers to reach. We modeled EVD transmission using a branching
process with gradually quenching transmission estimated from past EVD
outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course
of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We
used an autoregression for short-term projections, a regression model for final
sizes, and a simple Gott's law rule as an ensemble of forecasts. Short-term
model projections were validated against actual case counts. During validation
of short-term projections, models consistently scored higher on shorter-term
forecasts. Based on case counts as of October 13, the stochastic model
projected a median case count of 226 by October 27 (95% prediction interval:
205-268) and 245 by November 10 (95% PI: 208-315), while the auto-regression
model projected median case counts of 240 (95% PI: 215-307) and 259 (95% PI:
216-395) for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range
from 274 to 421. Except for Gott's law, the projected probability of an
outbreak surpassing 2013-2016 is exceedingly small. The stochastic model
estimates that vaccine coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its
trial. Based on our projections we believe that the epidemic had not yet peaked
at the time of these estimates, though an outbreak like 2013-2016 is not
likely. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than under target levels
of vaccine coverage, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator
for the outbreak response challenges.

established based on the SEIS-A framework. The prediction process contains two
phases. In phase I, the time series data of disease density are decomposed
through the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to obtain the intrinsic
mode functions (IMFs). In phase II, the ensemble learning techniques which use
the on-line query data as an additional input are applied to these IMFs.
Finally, experiments for prediction of weekly consultation rates of
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in Hong Kong are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The main advantage of this method is that
it outperforms other methods on fluctuating complex data.

  algorithms","  Motivation: HIV is difficult to treat because its virus mutates at a high
rate and mutated viruses easily develop resistance to existing drugs. If the
relationships between mutations and drug resistances can be determined from
historical data, patients can be provided personalized treatment according to
their own mutation information. The HIV Drug Resistance Database was built to
investigate the relationships. Our goal is to build a model using data in this
database, which simultaneously predicts the resistance of multiple drugs using
mutation information from sequences of viruses for any new patient.
  Results: We propose two variations of a stacking algorithm which borrow
information among multiple prediction tasks to improve multivariate prediction
performance. The most attractive feature of our proposed methods is the
flexibility with which complex multivariate prediction models can be
constructed using any univariate prediction models. Using cross-validation
studies, we show that our proposed methods outperform other popular
multivariate prediction methods.

  Collective Intelligence Multi-Model Integration Platform: Bayes Cloud","  The humanity has been facing a plethora of challenges associated with
infectious diseases, which kill more than 6 million people a year. Although
continuous efforts have been applied to relieve the potential damages from such
misfortunate events, it is unquestionable that there are many persisting
challenges yet to overcome. One related issue we particularly address here is
the assessment and prediction of such epidemics. In this field of study,
traditional and ad-hoc models frequently fail to provide proper predictive
situation awareness (PSAW), characterized by understanding the current
situations and predicting the future situations. Comprehensive PSAW for
infectious disease can support decision making and help to hinder disease
spread. In this paper, we develop a computing system platform focusing on
collective intelligence causal modeling, in order to support PSAW in the domain
of infectious disease. Analyses of global epidemics require integration of
multiple different data and models, which can be originated from multiple
independent researchers. These models should be integrated to accurately assess
and predict the infectious disease in terms of holistic view. The system shall
provide three main functions: (1) collaborative causal modeling, (2) causal
model integration, and (3) causal model reasoning. These functions are
supported by subject-matter expert and artificial intelligence (AI), with
uncertainty treatment. Subject-matter experts, as collective intelligence,
develop causal models and integrate them as one joint causal model. The
integrated causal model shall be used to reason about: (1) the past, regarding
how the causal factors have occurred; (2) the present, regarding how the spread
is going now; and (3) the future, regarding how it will proceed. Finally, we
introduce one use case of predictive situation awareness for the Ebola virus
disease.

  data","  Seasonal influenza infects between 10 and 50 million people in the United
States every year, overburdening hospitals during weeks of peak incidence.
Named by the CDC as an important tool to fight the damaging effects of these
epidemics, accurate forecasts of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI)
forewarn public health officials about when, and where, seasonal influenza
outbreaks will hit hardest. Multi-model ensemble forecasts---weighted
combinations of component models---have shown positive results in forecasting.
Ensemble forecasts of influenza outbreaks have been static, training on all
past ILI data at the beginning of a season, generating a set of optimal weights
for each model in the ensemble, and keeping the weights constant. We propose an
adaptive ensemble forecast that (i) changes model weights week-by-week
throughout the influenza season, (ii) only needs the current influenza season's
data to make predictions, and (iii) by introducing a prior distribution,
shrinks weights toward the reference equal weighting approach and adjusts for
observed ILI percentages that are subject to future revisions. We investigate
the prior's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance and, after finding
an optimal prior via a cross-validation approach, compare our adaptive
ensemble's performance to equal-weighted and static ensembles. Applied to
forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level in the
US, our adaptive model outperforms a naive equal-weighted ensemble, and has
similar or better performance to the static ensemble, which requires multiple
years of training data. Adaptive ensembles are able to quickly train and
forecast during epidemics, and provide a practical tool to public health
officials looking for forecasts that can conform to unique features of a
specific season.

propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network

in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the
previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate
the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free
methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson
distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According
to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for
controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission
of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring
Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to
end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence

of Covid-19 in China, we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired
methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the
provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for
helping public health planning and policymaking.

  Results show that this method works well for China: on day 25 we could have
predicted well the outcome for the next 35 days. The same method has been
applied to Italy and South Korea, and forecasts for the forthcoming weeks are
included in this work. For Italy, forecasts based on data collected up to today
(24 March) indicate that number of observed cases could grow from the current
value of 69,176, to between 101k-180k, with a 50% probability of being between
110k-135k. For South Korea, it suggests that the number of observed cases could
grow from the current value of 9,018 (as of the 23rd of March), to values
between 8,500 and 9,300, with a 50% probability of being between 8,700 and

  We conclude by suggesting that probabilistic disease prediction systems are

effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on
COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data
on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated
several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic
reproduction number ($R_{0}$). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model
with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the

where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population.
Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce
community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the
COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days.
Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number ($R_{t}$) during

coronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or
population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over
time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends
predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional
dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social
distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict
what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages
state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison
procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal
ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological
populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the
model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of
this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some
interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear
effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.

hospital-based transmission. Using daily notified COVID-19 cases from six

  Policy Assessment using Compartmental Gaussian Processes","  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led many
countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the
outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and
whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public
discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different
lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and
informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper
develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown
policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point,
and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific
policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior --
the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,
Recovered) model as a prior mean function with ""country-and-policy-specific""
parameters that capture fatality curves under ""counterfactual"" policies within
each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and
learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and
its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of
SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and
gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors)
-- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational
inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with
other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide

  counts in the United States","  As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, accurate forecasting continues to play an
extremely important role in informing policy decisions. In this paper, we
present our continuous curation of a large data repository containing COVID-19
information from a range of sources. We use this data to develop predictions
and corresponding prediction intervals for the short-term trajectory of
COVID-19 cumulative death counts at the county-level in the United States up to
two weeks ahead. Using data from January 22 to June 20, 2020, we develop and
combine multiple forecasts using ensembling techniques, resulting in an
ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our
individual predictors include county-specific exponential and linear
predictors, a shared exponential predictor that pools data together across
counties, an expanded shared exponential predictor that uses data from
neighboring counties, and a demographics-based shared exponential predictor. We
use prediction errors from the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our
death predictions, resulting in generally-applicable prediction intervals,
Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction Intervals (MEPI). MEPI achieves a coverage
rate of more than 94% when averaged across counties for predicting cumulative
recorded death counts two weeks in the future. Our forecasts are currently
being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the
medical supply need for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to
the distribution of medical supplies across the country. We hope that our
forecasts and data repository at https://covidseverity.com can help guide
necessary county-specific decision-making and help counties prepare for their
continued fight against COVID-19.

  estimating the intrinsic forecast uncertainty","  In the article a virus transmission model is constructed on a simplified
social network. The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each
representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and
interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center
distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly
distributed and fully-linked. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease
progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and
disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the
forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in
Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that
infection is currently twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly
care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) to
inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters and to estimate
the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic,
the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus
biology, i.e. its reproductive number. In the controlled epidemic with low
ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the
major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range
forecasts. Social-network-based models are thus essential for improving
epidemics forecasting.

  Level in Brazil","  Predicting an infectious disease can help reduce its impact by advising
public health interventions and personal preventive measures. Novel data
streams, such as Internet and social media data, have recently been reported to
benefit infectious disease prediction. As a case study of dengue in Brazil, we
have combined multiple traditional and non-traditional, heterogeneous data
streams (satellite imagery, Internet, weather, and clinical surveillance data)
across its 27 states on a weekly basis over seven years. For each state, we
nowcast dengue based on several time series models, which vary in complexity
and inclusion of exogenous data. The top-performing model varies by state,
motivating our consideration of ensemble approaches to automatically combine
these models for better outcomes at the state level. Model comparisons suggest
that predictions often improve with the addition of exogenous data, although
similar performance can be attained by including only one exogenous data stream
(either weather data or the novel satellite data) rather than combining all of
them. Our results demonstrate that Brazil can be nowcasted at the state level
with high accuracy and confidence, inform the utility of each individual data
stream, and reveal potential geographic contributors to predictive performance.
Our work can be extended to other spatial levels of Brazil, vector-borne
diseases, and countries, so that the spread of infectious disease can be more
effectively curbed.

  Classification using Chest X-ray Images","  The outbreak of COVID-19 has shocked the entire world with its fairly rapid
spread and has challenged different sectors. One of the most effective ways to
limit its spread is the early and accurate diagnosing infected patients.
Medical imaging, such as X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT), combined with the
potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), plays an essential role in
supporting medical personnel in the diagnosis process. Thus, in this article
five different deep learning models (ResNet18, ResNet34, InceptionV3,
InceptionResNetV2 and DenseNet161) and their ensemble, using majority voting
have been used to classify COVID-19, pneumoni{\ae} and healthy subjects using
chest X-ray images. Multilabel classification was performed to predict multiple
pathologies for each patient, if present. Firstly, the interpretability of each
of the networks was thoroughly studied using local interpretability methods -
occlusion, saliency, input X gradient, guided backpropagation, integrated
gradients, and DeepLIFT, and using a global technique - neuron activation
profiles. The mean Micro-F1 score of the models for COVID-19 classifications
ranges from 0.66 to 0.875, and is 0.89 for the ensemble of the network models.
The qualitative results showed that the ResNets were the most interpretable
models. This research demonstrates the importance of using interpretability
methods to compare different models before making a decision regarding the best
performing model.

applications, the model ensembles have been used to forecast daily incidence,

differences capture genuine uncertainty in the understanding of disease
dynamics and in the choice of simplifying assumptions underpinning the model.
Although analyses of multi-model ensembles can be logistically challenging when
time-frames are short, accounting for structural uncertainty can improve
accuracy and reduce the risk of over-confidence in predictions. In this study,
we compare the performance of various ensemble methods to combine short-term

  Kalman Filtering for Epidemic Models","  The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a popular sequential data assimilation
method that has been increasingly used for parameter estimation and forecast
prediction in epidemiological studies. The observation function plays a
critical role in the EnKF framework, connecting the unknown system variables
with the observed data. Key differences in observed data and modeling
assumptions have led to the use of different observation functions in the
epidemic modeling literature. In this work, we present a novel computational
analysis demonstrating the effects of observation function selection when using
the EnKF for state and parameter estimation in this setting. In examining the
use of four epidemiologically-inspired observation functions of different forms
in connection with the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, we
show how incorrect observation modeling assumptions (i.e., fitting incidence
data with a prevalence model, or neglecting under-reporting) can lead to
inaccurate filtering estimates and forecast predictions. Results demonstrate
the importance of choosing an observation function that well interprets the
available data on the corresponding EnKF estimates in several filtering
scenarios, including state estimation with known parameters, and combined state
and parameter estimation with both constant and time-varying parameters.
Numerical experiments further illustrate how modifying the observation noise
covariance matrix in the filter can help to account for uncertainty in the
observation function in certain cases.

where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their
different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test

  Analysis","  As per the records of theWorld Health Organization, the first formally
reported incidence of Zika virus occurred in Brazil in May 2015. The disease
then rapidly spread to other countries in Americas and East Asia, affecting
more than 1,000,000 people. Zika virus is primarily transmitted through bites
of infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus). The abundance of mosquitoes and, as a result, the prevalence of
Zika virus infections are common in areas which have high precipitation, high
temperature, and high population density.Nonlinear spatio-temporal dependency
of such data and lack of historical public health records make prediction of
the virus spread particularly challenging. In this article, we enhance Zika
forecasting by introducing the concepts of topological data analysis and,
specifically, persistent homology of atmospheric variables, into the virus
spread modeling. The topological summaries allow for capturing higher order
dependencies among atmospheric variables that otherwise might be unassessable
via conventional spatio-temporal modeling approaches based on geographical
proximity assessed via Euclidean distance. We introduce a new concept of
cumulative Betti numbers and then integrate the cumulative Betti numbers as
topological descriptors into three predictive machine learning models: random
forest, generalized boosted regression, and deep neural network. Furthermore,
to better quantify for various sources of uncertainties, we combine the
resulting individual model forecasts into an ensemble of the Zika spread
predictions using Bayesian model averaging. The proposed methodology is
illustrated in application to forecasting of the Zika space-time spread in
Brazil in the year 2018.

connect with large Internet service providers (eyeball networks) through
dedicated private peering. The capacity of these private network interconnects
is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users.
Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a
content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect
may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the
excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are
rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet
service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and
disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid
by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic
overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be
able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs
and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based
on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short
term horizon of 2-6 hours and predict the specific interconnections that will
ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic
measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a
true-positive rate of 0.8 while maintaining a 0.05 false-positive rate. The
lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the overflow prediction
accuracy. Nevertheless, starting from the end of April 2020 with the gradual
lockdown release, the old models trained before the pandemic perform equally
well.

  Forecasting","  The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant public health disaster
since the 1918 influenza pandemic. During pandemics such as COVID-19, timely
and reliable spatio-temporal forecasting of epidemic dynamics is crucial. Deep
learning-based time series models for forecasting have recently gained
popularity and have been successfully used for epidemic forecasting. Here we
focus on the design and analysis of deep learning-based models for COVID-19
forecasting. We implement multiple recurrent neural network-based deep learning
models and combine them using the stacking ensemble technique. In order to
incorporate the effects of multiple factors in COVID-19 spread, we consider
multiple sources such as COVID-19 confirmed and death case count data and
testing data for better predictions. To overcome the sparsity of training data
and to address the dynamic correlation of the disease, we propose
clustering-based training for high-resolution forecasting. The methods help us
to identify the similar trends of certain groups of regions due to various
spatio-temporal effects. We examine the proposed method for forecasting weekly
COVID-19 new confirmed cases at county-, state-, and country-level. A
comprehensive comparison between different time series models in COVID-19

models can achieve comparable or better performance when compared with more
complicated models. We are currently integrating our methods as a part of our

proved to be an excellent option for the automatic classification of medical
images. However, given the need of providing a confidence classification in

Performance of the Bayesian network is evaluated in a real scenario where

  Framework for COVID-19 Detection using Ensembles of Networks","  The new type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which started in Wuhan, China
in December 2019, continues to spread rapidly affecting the whole world. It is
essential to have a highly sensitive diagnostic screening tool to detect the
disease as early as possible. Currently, chest CT imaging is preferred as the
primary screening tool for evaluating the COVID-19 pneumonia by radiological
imaging. However, CT imaging requires larger radiation doses, longer exposure
time, higher cost, and may suffer from patient movements. X-Ray imaging is a
fast, cheap, more patient-friendly and available in almost every healthcare
facility. Therefore, we have focused on X-Ray images and developed an
end-to-end deep learning model, i.e. Ensemble-CVDNet, to distinguish COVID-19
pneumonia from non-COVID pneumonia and healthy cases in this work. The proposed
model is based on a combination of three lightweight pre-trained models
SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet-B0 at different depths, and combines
feature maps in different abstraction levels. In the proposed end to-end model,
networks are used as feature extractors in parallel after fine-tuning, and some
additional layers are used at the top of them. The proposed model is evaluated
in the COVID-19 Radiography Database, a public data set consisting of 219
COVID-19, 1341 Healthy, and 1345 Viral Pneumonia chest X-Ray images.

radiologists in the early diagnosis of the disease.

  Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach","  To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the
passenger's perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage,
airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews
(OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics
approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted
using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and
two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,
we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the
individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most
representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a
review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the
predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot
of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established
by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a
bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis
within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the
proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective
performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR.
Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our
results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the
airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.

Accordingly, uncertainty quantification methods are capable of flagging risky

  Learning","  In 2019, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases reached the highest number
in the US since 1992. Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content
propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay
and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for
antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine
messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have
considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags),
and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of
photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are
not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components
(e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we
propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual
information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to
help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal
antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can
generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble
method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To
evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset
that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between
January 2016 and October 2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the

straining the healthcare resources with an acute shortage of hospital beds and
ventilators for the critically ill patients. This situation is especially worse
in India with the second largest load of COVID-19 cases and a relatively
resource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to
triage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources
towards critically ill patients. Yan et al. 1 have published a very pertinent
research that uses Machine learning (ML) methods to predict the outcome of
COVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at the day of admission.
They used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the
mortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the
sequential addition of multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable
decision rule was obtained from a 'single-tree XGBoost' and used lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) values. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81%
mortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges
and do not provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other
populations as has been reported in the ""Matters Arising"" section of Yan et al.
Here, we show the limitations of this model by deploying it on one of the
largest datasets of COVID-19 patients containing detailed clinical parameters

issues we first consider mortality modelling in a Bayesian Negative-Binomial
framework to account for overdispersion and the uncertainty about the parameter
estimates in a natural and coherent way. Model averaging techniques are then
considered as a response to model misspecifications. In this paper, we propose
two methods based on leave-future-out validation which are compared to the
standard Bayesian model averaging (BMA) based on marginal likelihood. An
intensive numerical study is carried out over a large range of simulation
setups to compare the performances of the proposed methodologies. An
illustration is then proposed on real-life mortality datasets which includes a
sensitivity analysis to a Covid-type scenario. Overall, we found that both
methods based on out-of-sample criterion outperform the standard BMA approach
in terms of prediction performance and robustness.

  with a quadrature-based model","  Airborne viruses, such as influenza, tuberculosis, and SARS-CoV-2, are
transmitted through virus-laden particles expelled when an infectious person
sneezes, coughs, talks, or breathes. These virus-laden particles are more
highly concentrated in the expiratory jet of an infectious person than in a
well-mixed room, but this near-field enhancement in virion exposure has not
been well quantified. Transmission of airborne viruses depends on factors that
are inherently variable and, in many cases, poorly constrained, and quantifying
this uncertainty requires large ensembles of model simulations that span the
variability in input parameters. However, models that are well-suited to
simulate the near-field evolution of respiratory particles are also
computationally expensive, which limits the exploration of parametric
uncertainty. In order to perform many simulations that span the wide
variability in factors governing transmission, we developed the
Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD). QuaRAD is
an efficient framework for simulating the evolution of virus-laden particles
after they are expelled from an infectious person, their deposition to the
nasal cavity of a susceptible person, and the subsequent risk of initial
infection. We simulated 10,000 scenarios to quantify the risk of initial
infection by a particular virus, SARS-CoV-2. The predicted risk of infection
was highly variable among scenarios and, in each scenario, was strongly
enhanced near the infectious individual. In more than 50% of scenarios, the
physical distancing needed to avoid near-field enhancements in airborne
transmission was beyond the recommended safe distance of two meters (six feet)
if the infectious person is not wearing a mask, though this distance defining
the near-field extent was also highly variable among scenarios.

achieve scalable and prompt digital pre-screening. However, there are still two
unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model
training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users
tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features.
Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions.
Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the
uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an
ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19
detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data.
As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling
and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a
specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from
the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions
often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty
higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take
clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a
more robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system.

vision modelling efforts worldwide, focusing on diagnosis and stratification of

investigates the generalizability of key published models using the publicly

We then assess the predictive ability of these models for COVID-19 severity
using an independent new dataset that is stratified for COVID-19 lung

  Simulations","  Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a powerful data-driven method used to
extract spatio-temporal coherent structures that dictate a given dynamical
system. The method consists of stacking collected temporal snapshots into a
matrix and mapping the nonlinear dynamics using a linear operator. The standard
procedure considers that snapshots possess the same dimensionality for all the
observable data. However, this often does not occur in numerical simulations
with adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening schemes (AMR/C). This paper proposes a
strategy to enable DMD to extract features from observations with different
mesh topologies and dimensions, such as those found in AMR/C simulations. For
this purpose, the adaptive snapshots are projected onto the same reference
function space, enabling the use of snapshot-based methods such as DMD. The
present strategy is applied to challenging AMR/C simulations: a continuous
diffusion-reaction epidemiological model for COVID-19, a density-driven gravity
current simulation, and a bubble rising problem. We also evaluate the DMD
efficiency to reconstruct the dynamics and some relevant quantities of

vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief,
geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are
related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the
correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables
like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission
rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the
dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that
considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In
this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases
and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found
that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the
cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation

immediate priority. Such automatic systems are usually based on traditional

uncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g.
it is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods
like deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper,
we fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic

leverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations

Our extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that
EPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both

Applications behaves similarly to those of other econometrics, this work
explores the hypothesis of the existence (and, if so, the length scale(s)) of
economic cycles (periodicities). Methods: Beyond summary statistics, the
monthly (May, 1976 to December, 2020) number of observed FDA MD Applications
are investigated via an assortment of time series techniques (including:
Discrete Wavelet Transform, Running Moving Average Filter (RMAF), Complete
Ensemble Empirical Mode with Adaptive Noise decomposition (CEEMDAN), and
Seasonal Trend Loess (STL) decomposition) to exhaustively search and
characterize such periodicities. Results: The data were found to be non-normal,
non-stationary (fractional order of integration < 1), non-linear, and strongly
persistent (Hurst > 0.5). Importantly, periodicities exist and follow seasonal,
1 year short-term, 5-6 year (Juglar), and a single 24-year medium-term

Economic crises (e.g., COVID-19) do not seem to affect the evolution of the

be viewed as a proxy measure of the MD industry; (2) periodicities exists in
the data with time lengths associated with seasonal/1-year, Juglar and Kuznets
affects; (4) these metrics do not seem affected by specific crises (such as
COVID-19) (similarly with other econometrics used in periodicity assessments);
(5) PMNs and PMAs evolve inversely and suggest a structural industrial

  Correlation Loss for COVID-19 Progression Prediction","  COVID-19 image analysis has mostly focused on diagnostic tasks using single
timepoint scans acquired upon disease presentation or admission. We present a
deep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial
chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within
the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions.
The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN
feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused
representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation
loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature
vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote
regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states
of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as
an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future
timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate
patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease
severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the
previous temporal CXRs. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises
sequential CXR scans from N=93 patients. Our approach outperforms transfer
learning and radiomic feature-based baseline approaches on this dataset.

important part of infectious disease surveillance and helps guide health
officials in implementing effective countermeasures. For disease surveillance
in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) combine more
than 65 individual forecasts of these numbers in an ensemble forecast at
national and state levels. We collected data on CDC ensemble forecasts of
COVID-19 fatalities in the United States, and compare them with easily
interpretable ``Euler'' forecasts serving as a model-free benchmark that is
only based on the local rate of change of the incidence curve. The term ``Euler
method'' is motivated by the eponymous numerical integration scheme that
calculates the value of a function at a future time step based on the current
rate of change. Our results show that CDC ensemble forecasts are not more
accurate than ``Euler'' forecasts on short-term forecasting horizons of one
week. However, CDC ensemble forecasts show a better performance on longer
forecasting horizons. Using the current rate of change in incidences as
estimates of future incidence changes is useful for epidemic forecasting on
short time horizons. An advantage of the proposed method over other forecasting
approaches is that it can be implemented with a very limited amount of work and
without relying on additional data (e.g., human mobility and contact patterns)
and high-performance computing systems.

direction that provides clinicians access to relevant key-frames from a given

bandwidth requirements. We propose a new unsupervised reinforcement learning
(RL) framework with novel rewards that facilitates unsupervised learning
avoiding tedious and impractical manual labelling for summarizing ultrasound
videos to enhance its utility as a triage tool in the emergency department (ED)

dimensional image is projected into a low dimensional latent space in terms of:
a) reduced distance with a normal or abnormal class (classifier encoder), b)
following a topology of landmarks (segmentation encoder), and c) the distance
or topology agnostic latent representation (convolutional autoencoders). The
decoder is implemented using a bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM)
which utilizes the latent space representation from the encoder. Our new
paradigm for video summarization is capable of delivering classification labels

  Applications to COVID-19 Excess Mortality Estimation","  It is increasingly common to encounter prediction tasks in the biomedical
sciences for which multiple datasets are available for model training. Common
approaches such as pooling datasets and applying standard statistical learning
methods can result in poor out-of-study prediction performance when datasets
are heterogeneous. Theoretical and applied work has shown $\textit{multi-study
ensembling}$ to be a viable alternative that leverages the variability across
datasets in a manner that promotes model generalizability. Multi-study
ensembling uses a two-stage $\textit{stacking}$ strategy which fits
study-specific models and estimates ensemble weights separately. This approach
ignores, however, the ensemble properties at the model-fitting stage,
potentially resulting in a loss of efficiency. We therefore propose
$\textit{optimal ensemble construction}$, an $\textit{all-in-one}$ approach to
multi-study stacking whereby we jointly estimate ensemble weights as well as
parameters associated with each study-specific model. We prove that limiting
cases of our approach yield existing methods such as multi-study stacking and
pooling datasets before model fitting. We propose an efficient block coordinate
descent algorithm to optimize the proposed loss function. We compare our
approach to standard methods by applying it to a multi-country COVID-19 dataset

for a country before the onset of the pandemic, leveraging data from other

  incidence at the county level in the USA","  With COVID-19 affecting every country globally and changing everyday life,
the ability to forecast the spread of the disease is more important than any
previous epidemic. The conventional methods of disease-spread modeling,
compartmental models, are based on the assumption of spatiotemporal homogeneity
of the spread of the virus, which may cause forecasting to underperform,
especially at high spatial resolutions. In this paper we approach the
forecasting task with an alternative technique - spatiotemporal machine
learning. We present COVID-LSTM, a data-driven model based on a Long Short-term
Memory deep learning architecture for forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the
county-level in the US. We use the weekly number of new positive cases as

to be more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble over one or more forecast
periods. Over the 4-week forecast horizon, our model is on average 50 cases per
county more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble. We highlight that the
underutilization of data-driven forecasting of disease spread prior to COVID-19
is likely due to the lack of sufficient data available for previous diseases,
in addition to the recent advances in machine learning methods for

  data assimilation","  To represent the complex individual interactions in the dynamics of disease
spread informed by data, the coupling of an epidemiological agent-based model
with the ensemble Kalman filter is proposed. The statistical inference of the
propagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems
has been studied in previous work. The models used are mostly compartmental
models representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential
equations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections
from data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest.
However, there are many important features which are based on the individual
interactions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as
social network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and
social network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe
contact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such
as age, neighbourhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places,
among others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which
are thus difficult to estimate. In this work, we propose the use of
ensemble-based data assimilation techniques to calibrate an agent-based model
using daily epidemiological data. This raises the challenge of having to adapt
the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the
coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model
predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed
observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key
epidemiological parameters. We conduct experiments with an agent based-model
designed for COVID-19 and assess the proposed methodology on synthetic data and
on COVID-19 daily reports from Ciudad Aut\'onoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.

  X-rays","  Chest X-ray (CXR) is a widely performed radiology examination that helps to
detect abnormalities in the tissues and organs in the thoracic cavity.
Detecting pulmonary abnormalities like COVID-19 may become difficult due to
that they are obscured by the presence of bony structures like the ribs and the
clavicles, thereby resulting in screening/diagnostic misinterpretations.
Automated bone suppression methods would help suppress these bony structures
and increase soft tissue visibility. In this study, we propose to build an
ensemble of convolutional neural network models to suppress bones in frontal
CXRs, improve classification performance, and reduce interpretation errors
related to COVID-19 detection. The ensemble is constructed by (i) measuring the
multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) score between the sub-blocks
of the bone-suppressed image predicted by each of the top-3 performing
bone-suppression models and the corresponding sub-blocks of its respective
ground truth soft-tissue image, and (ii) performing a majority voting of the
MS-SSIM score computed in each sub-block to identify the sub-block with the
maximum MS-SSIM score and use it in constructing the final bone-suppressed
image. We empirically determine the sub-block size that delivers superior bone
suppression performance. It is observed that the bone suppression model
ensemble outperformed the individual models in terms of MS-SSIM and other
metrics. A CXR modality-specific classification model is retrained and
evaluated on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed images to classify
them as showing normal lungs or other COVID-19-like manifestations. We observed
that the bone-suppressed model training significantly outperformed the model
trained on non-bone-suppressed images toward detecting COVID-19 manifestations.

  ground prediction in Africa","  Desert locust outbreaks threaten the food security of a large part of Africa
and have affected the livelihoods of millions of people over the years. Machine
learning (ML) has been demonstrated as an effective approach to locust
distribution modelling which could assist in early warning. ML requires a
significant amount of labelled data to train. Most publicly available labelled
data on locusts are presence-only data, where only the sightings of locusts
being present at a location are recorded. Therefore, prior work using ML have
resorted to pseudo-absence generation methods as a way to circumvent this
issue. The most commonly used approach is to randomly sample points in a region
of interest while ensuring that these sampled pseudo-absence points are at
least a specific distance away from true presence points. In this paper, we
compare this random sampling approach to more advanced pseudo-absence
generation methods, such as environmental profiling and optimal background
extent limitation, specifically for predicting desert locust breeding grounds
in Africa. Interestingly, we find that for the algorithms we tested, namely
logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forests and maximum entropy, all
popular in prior work, the logistic model performed significantly better than
the more sophisticated ensemble methods, both in terms of prediction accuracy
and F1 score. Although background extent limitation combined with random
sampling boosted performance for ensemble methods, for LR this was not the
case, and instead, a significant improvement was obtained when using
environmental profiling. In light of this, we conclude that a simpler ML
approach such as logistic regression combined with more advanced pseudo-absence
generation, specifically environmental profiling, can be a sensible and
effective approach to predicting locust breeding grounds across Africa.

  Lyα galaxy survey: How to probe the early universe with voxel based
  analysis of observational data","  Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) offers a novel avenue to observe and
characterize our universe. LIM data of CO spectral lines are becoming
available, such as those obtained by the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP).
COMAP data can be used to probe the molecular gas content of the universe from
the last stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) ($z < 8.0$) to $z \sim 2.5$.
In this work, we examine the prospects for deriving voxel-level statistical
constraints on high-redshift galaxies from COMAP data by considering the
additional information available from observations of LAEs galaxies using the
Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) on the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope (HET). We post-process the IllustrisTNG300 galaxy-formation
simulation with a set of prescriptions to consistently determine CO and
Ly$\alpha$ line luminosities. The different line prescriptions span the
uncertainty in the CO line luminosity according to current observations by the
VLA high-z CO surveys and set the Ly$\alpha$ emission to be compatible with
observational LAE luminosity functions. We produce mock observations for the
two surveys over a $(300\, {\rm Mpc})^3$ volume. These are then used to
formulate and test methodologies for data analysis and to predict COMAP
constraints on CO emission. We use combinations of masking, stacking, voxel
intensity distribution (VID), and other statistics. We find that in combination
with VIRUS/HET, a voxel-level analysis of the COMAP Pathfinder survey can
detect and characterize the CO signal from $z\sim3$ and improve current
constraints on the $z\sim6$ signal, identify individual voxels with bright
CO(1-0) emission at $z\sim3$ and probe the redshift evolution of the CO
emission. This study illustrates the potential of synergies between LIM and
galaxy surveys both to improve the significance of a detection and to aid the
interpretation of noisy LIM data.

  SubReddit Data","  Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our society and human
well-being in various ways. In this study, we investigate how the pandemic has
influenced people's emotions and psychological states compared to a
pre-pandemic period using real-world data from social media.
  Method: We collected Reddit social media data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and
2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight
universities. We applied the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training
approach (RoBERTa) to learn text embedding from the Reddit messages, and
leveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph
attention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. Finally, we applied model
stacking to combine the prediction probabilities from RoBERTa and GAT to yield
the final classification on sentiment. With the model-predicted sentiment
labels on the collected data, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model
to estimate the effects of pandemic and in-person teaching during the pandemic
on sentiment.
  Results: The results suggest that the odds of negative sentiments in 2020
(pandemic) were 25.7% higher than the odds in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with a
$p$-value $<0.001$; and the odds of negative sentiments associated in-person
learning were 48.3% higher than with remote learning in 2020 with a $p$-value
of 0.029.
  Conclusions: Our study results are consistent with the findings in the
literature on the negative impacts of the pandemic on people's emotions and
psychological states. Our study contributes to the growing real-world evidence
on the various negative impacts of the pandemic on our society; it also
provides a good example of using both ML techniques and statistical modeling
and inference to make better use of real-world data.

  Video Lectures","  Predicting contextualised engagement in videos is a long-standing problem
that has been popularly attempted by exploiting the number of views or the
associated likes using different computational methods. The recent decade has
seen a boom in online learning resources, and during the pandemic, there has
been an exponential rise of online teaching videos without much quality
control. The quality of the content could be improved if the creators could get
constructive feedback on their content. Employing an army of domain expert
volunteers to provide feedback on the videos might not scale. As a result,
there has been a steep rise in developing computational methods to predict a
user engagement score that is indicative of some form of possible user
engagement, i.e., to what level a user would tend to engage with the content. A
drawback in current methods is that they model various features separately, in
a cascaded approach, that is prone to error propagation. Besides, most of them
do not provide crucial explanations on how the creator could improve their
content. In this paper, we have proposed a new unified model, CLUE for the
educational domain, which learns from the features extracted from freely
available public online teaching videos and provides explainable feedback on
the video along with a user engagement score. Given the complexity of the task,
our unified framework employs different pre-trained models working together as
an ensemble of classifiers. Our model exploits various multi-modal features to
model the complexity of language, context agnostic information, textual emotion
of the delivered content, animation, speaker's pitch and speech emotions. Under
a transfer learning setup, the overall model, in the unified space, is
fine-tuned for downstream applications.

  Approach","  Ride-hailing is rapidly changing urban and personal transportation. Ride
sharing or pooling is important to mitigate negative externalities of
ride-hailing such as increased congestion and environmental impacts. However,
there lacks empirical evidence on what affect trip-level sharing behavior in
ride-hailing. Using a novel dataset from all ride-hailing trips in Chicago in
2019, we show that the willingness of riders to request a shared ride has
monotonically decreased from 27.0% to 12.8% throughout the year, while the trip
volume and mileage have remained statistically unchanged. We find that the
decline in sharing preference is due to an increased per-mile costs of shared
trips and shifting shorter trips to solo. Using ensemble machine learning
models, we find that the travel impedance variables (trip cost, distance, and
duration) collectively contribute to 95% and 91% of the predictive power in
determining whether a trip is requested to share and whether it is successfully
shared, respectively. Spatial and temporal attributes, sociodemographic, built
environment, and transit supply variables do not entail predictive power at the
trip level in presence of these travel impedance variables. This implies that
pricing signals are most effective to encourage riders to share their rides.
Our findings shed light on sharing behavior in ride-hailing trips and can help
devise strategies that increase shared ride-hailing, especially as the demand
recovers from pandemic.

known as the FluSight challenge. A subset of participating teams has worked
together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble, the FluSight Network
ensemble. Uniting theoretical results from the forecasting literature with
domain-specific forecasts from influenza outbreaks, we applied parametric
forecast combination methods that simultaneously optimize individual model
weights and calibrate the ensemble via a beta transformation. We used the
beta-transformed linear pool and the finite beta mixture model to produce
ensemble forecasts retrospectively for the 2016/2017 to 2018/2019 influenza

  epidemic model using ensemble neural networks","  In this paper, we propose a parameter identification methodology of the SIRD
model, an extension of the classical SIR model, that considers the deceased as
a separate category. In addition, our model includes one parameter which is the
ratio between the real total number of infected and the number of infected that
were documented in the official statistics.
  Due to many factors, like governmental decisions, several variants
circulating, opening and closing of schools, the typical assumption that the
parameters of the model stay constant for long periods of time is not
realistic. Thus our objective is to create a method which works for short
periods of time. In this scope, we approach the estimation relying on the
previous 7 days of data and then use the identified parameters to make
predictions.
  To perform the estimation of the parameters we propose the average of an
ensemble of neural networks. Each neural network is constructed based on a
database built by solving the SIRD for 7 days, with random parameters. In this
way, the networks learn the parameters from the solution of the SIRD model.
  Lastly we use the ensemble to get estimates of the parameters from the real
data of Covid19 in Romania and then we illustrate the predictions for different
periods of time, from 10 up to 45 days, for the number of deaths. The main goal
was to apply this approach on the analysis of COVID-19 evolution in Romania,
but this was also exemplified on other countries like Hungary, Czech Republic
and Poland with similar results.
  The results are backed by a theorem which guarantees that we can recover the

be used as a general tool for dealing with short term predictions of infectious

implicit feedback control strategies which are implemented by populations to
modulate the spread of contagion. While this task of capturing endogenous
behavior can be achieved through intricate modeling assumptions, we find that a
population's reaction to case counts can be described through a second order
affine dynamical system with linear control which fits well to the data across
different regions and times throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The model fits
the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United
States, with comparable $R^2$ scores to state of the art ensemble predictions.
In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that
individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of
disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their
number of interactions, i.e. they control the derivative of the contact rate.
We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it
correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the
dynamical model is that the ""stable"" point of case counts is non-zero, i.e.
COVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and
strategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly.
Hence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making
interventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of
cumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of
eradicating COVID-19.

data for quantifying extreme events with an ensemble of DNOs that approximate
infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators. We find that not only does this
framework clearly beat Gaussian processes (GPs) but that 1) shallow ensembles
of just two members perform best; 2) extremes are uncovered regardless of the
state of initial data (i.e. with or without extremes); 3) our method eliminates
""double-descent"" phenomena; 4) the use of batches of suboptimal acquisition
points compared to step-by-step global optima does not hinder BED performance;
and 5) Monte Carlo acquisition outperforms standard optimizers in
high-dimensions. Together these conclusions form the foundation of an
AI-assisted experimental infrastructure that can efficiently infer and pinpoint
critical situations across many domains, from physical to societal systems.

suffer from extended wait times beyond patient expectations due to inadequate
staffing levels. These delays have been linked with adverse clinical outcomes.
Previous research into forecasting demand this domain has mostly used a
collection of statistical techniques, with machine learning approaches only now
beginning to emerge in recent literature. The forecasting problem for this
domain is difficult and has also been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic
which has introduced an additional complexity to this estimation due to typical
demand patterns being disrupted. This study explores the ability of machine
learning methods to generate accurate patient presentations at two large urgent
care clinics located in Auckland, New Zealand. A number of machine learning
algorithms were explored in order to determine the most effective technique for
this problem domain, with the task of making forecasts of daily patient demand
three months in advance. The study also performed an in-depth analysis into the
model behaviour in respect to the exploration of which features are most
effective at predicting demand and which features are capable of adaptation to
the volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The results showed
that ensemble-based methods delivered the most accurate and consistent

public health planning so that hospitals can be better prepared for an influx
of patients. Many forecasting methods have been used in real-time during the
Influenza seasons and submitted to the CDC for public communication. The
forecasting models range from mechanistic models, and auto-regression models to
machine learning models. We hypothesize that we can improve forecasting by
using multiple mechanistic models to produce potential trajectories and use
machine learning to learn how to combine those trajectories into an improved
forecast. We propose a Tree Ensemble model design that utilizes the individual
predictors of our baseline model SIkJalpha to improve its performance. Each
predictor is generated by changing a set of hyper-parameters. We compare our
prospective forecasts deployed for the FluSight challenge (2022) to all the

mean absolute error, coverage, and weighted interval score. Our method
outperforms all other models in terms of the mean absolute error and the

  Epidemics","  Infectious diseases remain among the top contributors to human illness and
death worldwide, among which many diseases produce epidemic waves of infection.
The unavailability of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most
of these epidemics makes the situation worse. These force public health
officials and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by
reliable and accurate forecasts of epidemics. Accurate forecasts of epidemics
can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination
campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand,
which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately,
most of these past epidemics exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary
characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent
variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyse a wide variety of
epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet
transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it EWNet model.
MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal
dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the nonlinear forecasting
scheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet
network framework. From a nonlinear time series viewpoint, we explore the
asymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic
behavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the
effect of learning stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposal.
From a practical perspective, we compare our proposed EWNet framework with
several statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Experimental
results show that the proposed EWNet is highly competitive compared to the

modeling involve multiple teams independently producing projections under
various scenarios. Often these scenarios are produced by the presence and
absence of a decision in the future, e.g., no vaccinations (scenario A) vs
vaccinations (scenario B) available in the future. The models submit
probabilistic projections for each of the scenarios. Obtaining a confidence
interval on the impact of the decision (e.g., number of deaths averted) is
important for decision making. However, obtaining tight bounds only from the
probabilistic projections for the individual scenarios is difficult, as the
joint probability is not known. Further, the models may not be able to generate
the joint probability distribution due to various reasons including the need to
rewrite simulations, and storage and transfer requirements.
  Without asking the submitting models for additional work, we aim to estimate
a non-trivial bound on the outcomes due to the decision variable. We first
prove, under a key assumption, that an $\alpha-$confidence interval on the
difference of scenario predictions can be obtained given only the quantiles of
the predictions. Then we show how to estimate a confidence interval after
relaxing that assumption. We use our approach to estimate confidence intervals
on reduction in cases, deaths, and hospitalizations due to vaccinations based
on model submissions to the US Scenario Modeling Hub.

performed, communicated, and evaluated as numerical targets - 1, 2, 3, and 4
week ahead cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. While there is great value in
predicting these numerical targets to assess the burden of the disease, we
argue that there is also value in communicating the future trend (description
of the shape) of the epidemic -- for instance, if the cases will remain flat or
a surge is expected. To ensure what is being communicated is useful we need to
be able to evaluate how well the predicted shape matches with the ground truth
shape. Instead of treating this as a classification problem (one out of $n$
shapes), we define a transformation of the numerical forecasts into a
``shapelet''-space representation. In this representation, each dimension
corresponds to the similarity of the shape with one of the shapes of interest
(a shapelet). We prove that this representation satisfies the property that two
shapes that one would consider similar are mapped close to each other, and vice
versa. We demonstrate that our representation is able to reasonably capture the
trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths time-series. With this representation, we
define an evaluation measure and a measure of agreement among multiple models.
We also define the shapelet-space ensemble of multiple models as the mean of
their shapelet-space representations. We show that this ensemble is able to
accurately predict the shape of the future trend for COVID-19 cases and trends.
We also show that the agreement between models can provide a good indicator of
the reliability of the forecast.

  diffusion in multiplex networks","  Understanding the interplay between human behavioral phenomena and infectious
disease dynamics has been one of the central challenges of mathematical
epidemiology. However, socio-cognitive processes critical for the initiation of
desired behavioral responses during an outbreak have often been neglected or
oversimplified in earlier models. Combining the microscopic Markov chain
approach with the law of total probability, we herein institute a mathematical
model describing the dynamic interplay between stage-based progression of
awareness diffusion and endemic disease transmission in multiplex networks. We
analytically derived the epidemic thresholds for both discrete-time and
continuous-time versions of our model, and we numerically demonstrated the
accuracy of our analytic arguments in capturing the time course and the
steady-state of the coupled disease-awareness dynamics. We found that our model
is exact for arbitrary unclustered multiplex networks, outperforming a widely
adopted probability-tree-based method, both in the prediction of the
time-evolution of a contagion and in the final epidemic size. Our findings show
that informing the unaware individuals about the circulating disease will not
be sufficient for the prevention of an outbreak unless the distributed
information triggers strong awareness of infection risks with adequate
protective measures, and that the immunity of highly-aware individuals can
elevate the epidemic threshold, but only if the rate of transition from weak to
strong awareness is sufficiently high. Our study thus reveals that awareness
diffusion and other behavioral parameters can nontrivially interact when
producing their effects on epidemiological dynamics of an infectious disease,
suggesting that future public health measures should not ignore this complex
behavioral interplay and its influence on contagion transmission in
multilayered networked systems.

problems: mask detection and breathing state prediction. Solutions developed
for these tasks could be invaluable and have the potential to help monitor and
limit the spread of a virus like COVID-19. The current state-of-the-art methods
proposed for these tasks are ensembles based on deep neural networks like
ResNets in conjunction with feature engineering. Although these ensembles can
achieve high accuracy, they also have a large footprint and require substantial
computational power reducing portability to devices with limited resources.
These drawbacks also mean that the previously proposed solutions are infeasible

hand, employing lighter feature-engineered systems can be laborious and add
further complexity making them difficult to create a deployable system quickly.

subtropical countries in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. This arboviral disease
affects around 400 million people globally, severely distressing the healthcare
systems. The unavailability of a specific drug and ready-to-use vaccine makes
the situation worse. Hence, policymakers must rely on early warning systems to
control intervention-related decisions. Forecasts routinely provide critical
information for dangerous epidemic events. However, the available forecasting
models (e.g., weather-driven mechanistic, statistical time series, and machine
learning models) lack a clear understanding of different components to improve
prediction accuracy and often provide unstable and unreliable forecasts. This
study proposes an ensemble wavelet neural network with exogenous factor(s)
(XEWNet) model that can produce reliable estimates for dengue outbreak
prediction for three geographical regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and
Ahmedabad. The proposed XEWNet model is flexible and can easily incorporate
exogenous climate variable(s) confirmed by statistical causality tests in its
scalable framework. The proposed model is an integrated approach that uses
wavelet transformation into an ensemble neural network framework that helps in
generating more reliable long-term forecasts. The proposed XEWNet allows
complex non-linear relationships between the dengue incidence cases and
rainfall; however, mathematically interpretable, fast in execution, and easily
comprehensible. The proposal's competitiveness is measured using computational
experiments based on various statistical metrics and several statistical
comparison tests. In comparison with statistical, machine learning, and deep

  Tracking and Forecasting","  Data assimilation techniques, such as ensemble Kalman filtering, have been
shown to be a highly effective and efficient way to combine noisy data with a
mathematical model to track and forecast dynamical systems. However, when
dealing with high-dimensional data, in many situations one does not have a
model, so data assimilation techniques cannot be applied. In this paper, we use
dynamic mode decomposition to generate a low-dimensional, linear model of a
dynamical system directly from high-dimensional data, which is defined by
temporal and spatial modes, that we can then use with data assimilation
techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter. We show how the dynamic mode
decomposition can be combined with the ensemble Kalman filter (which we call
the DMDEnKF) to iteratively update the current state and temporal modes as new
data becomes available. We demonstrate that this approach is able to track time
varying dynamical systems in synthetic examples, and experiment with the use of
time-delay embeddings. We then apply the DMDEnKF to real world seasonal
influenza-like illness data from the USA Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and find that for short term forecasting, the DMDEnKF is comparable
to the best mechanistic models in the ILINet competition.

supervised machine-learning algorithm to build our model for outbreaks of the
novel Coronavirus that has spread over the whole world and caused many deaths,
which is one of the most disastrous Pandemics in the history of the world. The
people suffered physically and economically to survive in this lockdown. This

learning models work and are implemented in the real dataset. In our work, we
are going to analyze the current trend or pattern of the coronavirus and then
predict the further future of the covid-19 confirmed cases or new cases by
training the past Covid-19 dataset by using the machine learning algorithm such
as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, K-nearest neighbor, Decision Tree,
Support Vector Machine and Random forest algorithm are used to train the model.
The decision tree and the Random Forest algorithm perform better than SVR in
this work. The performance of SVR and lasso regression are low in all
prediction areas Because the SVR is challenging to separate the data using the
hyperplane for this type of problem. So SVR mostly gives a lower performance in
this problem. Ensemble (Voting, Bagging, and Stacking) and deep learning
models(ANN) also predict well. After the prediction, we evaluated the model
using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. This work aims to find the trend/pattern of the

data augmentation technique to generate useful data for training. More
importantly, the generated data can also be used for model validation. As such,
it has a two-fold advantage: 1) more actual observations can be used for
training, and 2) the model can be validated on data which has distribution
closer to the expected situation. Our model has achieved some of the best
state-level results on the COVID-19 Forecast Hub for the US and for Germany.

rapid policy diffusion, where countries constitute the agents and with the
principal mechanism for diffusion being peer mimicry. Since it is challenging
to predict accurately the policy diffusion curve, we utilize data assimilation,
that is an ``on-line'' feed of data to constrain the model against
observations. The specific data assimilation algorithm we apply is a particle
filter because of its convenient implementation, its ability to handle
categorical variables and because the model is not overly computationally
expensive, hence a more efficient algorithm is not required. We find that the
model alone is able to predict the policy diffusion relatively well with an
ensemble of at least 100 simulation runs. The particle filter however improves
the fit to the data, reliably so from 500 runs upwards, and increasing
filtering frequency results in improved prediction.

work models (combinations of co-located and remote work) as software
professionals' demanded more flexibility and improved work-life balance.
However, hybrid work models reduce the spontaneous, informal face-to-face
interactions that promote group maturation, cohesion, and resilience. Little is
known about how software companies can successfully transition to a hybrid
workforce or the factors that influence the resilience of hybrid software
development teams. Goal. The purpose of this study is to explore the
relationship between hybrid work and team resilience in the context of software
development. Method. Constructivist Grounded Theory was used, based on
interviews of 26 software professionals. This sample included professionals of
different genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and levels of experience.
Interviewees came from eight different companies, 22 different projects, and
four different countries. Consistent with grounded theory methodology, data
collection, and analysis were conducted iteratively, in waves, using
theoretical sampling, constant comparison, and initial, focused, and
theoretical coding. Results. Software Team Resilience is the ability of a group
of software professionals to continue working together effectively under
adverse conditions. Resilience depends on the group's maturity. The
configuration of a hybrid team (who works where and when) can promote or hinder
group maturity depending on the level of intra-group interaction it supports.
Conclusion. This paper presents the first study on the resilience of hybrid
software teams. Software teams need resilience to maintain their performance in
the face of disruptions and crises. Software professionals strongly value
hybrid work; therefore, team resilience is a key factor to be considered in the
software industry.

  Applications to Sector Rotation Strategy","  Asset-specific factors are commonly used to forecast financial returns and
quantify asset-specific risk premia. Using various machine learning models, we
demonstrate that the information contained in these factors leads to even
larger economic gains in terms of forecasts of sector returns and the
measurement of sector-specific risk premia. To capitalize on the strong
predictive results of individual models for the performance of different
sectors, we develop a novel online ensemble algorithm that learns to optimize
predictive performance. The algorithm continuously adapts over time to
determine the optimal combination of individual models by solely analyzing
their most recent prediction performance. This makes it particularly suited for
time series problems, rolling window backtesting procedures, and systems of
potentially black-box models. We derive the optimal gain function, express the
corresponding regret bounds in terms of the out-of-sample R-squared measure,
and derive optimal learning rate for the algorithm. Empirically, the new
ensemble outperforms both individual machine learning models and their simple
averages in providing better measurements of sector risk premia. Moreover, it
allows for performance attribution of different factors across various sectors,
without conditioning on a specific model. Finally, by utilizing monthly
predictions from our ensemble, we develop a sector rotation strategy that
significantly outperforms the market. The strategy remains robust against
various financial factors, periods of financial distress, and conservative
transaction costs. Notably, the strategy's efficacy persists over time,
exhibiting consistent improvement throughout an extended backtesting period and

epidemic spreading on graphs in the thermodynamic limit. The typical inference
tasks consist in computing observables of the posterior distribution of the
epidemic model given observations taken from a ground truth (sometimes called
planted) random trajectory. We can identify two main sources of quenched
disorder: the graph ensemble and the planted trajectory. The epidemic dynamics
however induces non-trivial long-range correlations among individuals' states
on the latter. This results in non-local correlated quenched disorder which
unfortunately is typically hard to handle. To overcome this difficulty, we
divide the dynamical process into two sets of variables: a set of stochastic
independent variables (representing transmission delays), plus a set of
correlated variables (the infection times) that depend deterministically on the
first. Treating the former as quenched variables and the latter as dynamic
ones, computing disorder average becomes feasible by means of the Replica
Symmetric cavity method. We give theoretical predictions on the posterior
probability distribution of the trajectory of each individual, conditioned to
observations on the state of individuals at given times, focusing on the
Susceptible Infectious (SI) model. In the Bayes-optimal condition, i.e. when
true dynamic parameters are known, the inference task is expected to fall in
the Replica Symmetric regime. We indeed provide predictions for the information
theoretic limits of various inference tasks, in form of phase diagrams. We also
identify a region, in the Bayes-Optimal setting, with strong hints of Replica
Symmetry Breaking. When true parameters are unknown, we show how a
maximum-likelihood procedure is able to recover them with mostly unaffected
performance.

forecast combining enables a pragmatic synthesis of the information to extract
the wisdom of the crowd. The linear opinion pool has been widely used, whereby
the combining is applied to the probabilities of the distributional forecasts.
However, it has been argued that this will tend to deliver overdispersed
distributions, prompting the combination to be applied, instead, to the
quantiles of the distributional forecasts. Results from different applications
are mixed, leaving it as an empirical question whether to combine probabilities
or quantiles. In this paper, we present an alternative approach. Looking at the
distributional forecasts, combining the probabilities can be viewed as vertical
combining, with quantile combining seen as horizontal combining. Our proposal
is to allow combining to take place on an angle between the extreme cases of
vertical and horizontal combining. We term this angular combining. The angle is
a parameter that can be optimized using a proper scoring rule. For
implementation, we provide a pragmatic numerical approach and a simulation
algorithm. Among our theoretical results, we show that, as with vertical and
horizontal averaging, angular averaging results in a distribution with mean
equal to the average of the means of the distributions that are being combined.
We also show that angular averaging produces a distribution with lower variance
than vertical averaging, and, under certain assumptions, greater variance than
horizontal averaging. We provide empirical results for distributional forecasts
of Covid mortality, macroeconomic survey data, and electricity prices.

  in Switzerland","  Switzerland experienced one of the warmest summers during 2022. Extreme heat
has been linked to increased mortality. Monitoring the mortality burden
attributable to extreme heat is crucial to inform policies, such as heat
warnings, and prevent heat-related deaths. In this study, we evaluate excess
mortality during summer 2022, identify vulnerable populations and estimate
temperature thresholds for heat warnings. We use nationwide mortality and
population data in Switzerland during 2011-2022 by age, sex, day and canton. We
develop a Bayesian ensemble modelling approach with dynamic population to
predict expected mortality in summer 2022 and calculate excess by comparing
expected with observed mortality. We account for covariates associated with
mortality such as ambient temperature, national holidays and spatiotemporal
random effects to improve predictions. After accounting for the effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we found a 3% (95% credible interval: 0%-6%) excess
mortality during summer 2022. We observed a total of 456 (5-891) excess deaths
during summer 2022 in people older than 80 years. There was weak evidence of
excess mortality in the other age groups. The highest excess mortality was
observed in July (12%: 4%-19%), the hottest month in 2022. We also found that
for heatwaves longer than four days, the minimum excess mortality temperature
threshold in the oldest age group is the 70th percentile of the temperature. To
reduce future summer excess mortality in Switzerland, we propose targeted heat
warnings to older populations and reducing the temperature threshold when
weather forecasts predict periods of extreme heat of four days or longer.

around the world. Much of the epidemiological modeling was based on

due to governmental health measures, so called non-pharmaceutical interventions

parameterizations of the transmission matrix. These experiments show that it is
not possible to unambiguously estimate all the independent parameters of the
transmission matrix. However, under certain parameterizations, the transmission
matrix in an age-compartmental model can be estimated. These estimated
parameters lead to an increase of forecast accuracy in agegroups compartments

teams, ensuring that each team's model represents forecast uncertainty
according to the same format allows for direct comparison of forecasts as well

several common probabilistic forecast representation formats including
parametric distributions, sample distributions, bin distributions, and
quantiles and compares their use in the context of collaborative projects. We
propose the use of a discrete mixture distribution format in collaborative
forecasting in place of other formats. The flexibility in distribution shape,
the ease for scoring and building ensemble models, and the reasonably low level
of computer storage required to store such a forecast make the discrete mixture
distribution an attractive alternative to the other representation formats.

Controllable Ensemble Transformer and CNN (CETC) for the analysis of medical

neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to effectively capture both local and
global features present in medical images. The model architecture comprises
three main components: a convolutional encoder block (CEB), a
transposed-convolutional decoder block (TDB), and a transformer classification
block (TCB). The CEB is responsible for capturing multi-local features at
different scales and draws upon components from VGGNet, ResNet, and MobileNet
as backbones. By leveraging this combination, the CEB is able to effectively
detect and encode local features. The TDB, on the other hand, consists of
sub-decoders that decode and sum the captured features using ensemble
coefficients. This enables the model to efficiently integrate the information
from multiple scales. Finally, the TCB utilizes the SwT backbone and a
specially designed prediction head to capture global features, ensuring a
comprehensive understanding of the entire image. The paper provides detailed
information on the experimental setup and implementation, including the use of
transfer learning, data preprocessing techniques, and training settings. The
CETC model is trained and evaluated using two publicly available COVID-19

significant challenges in early detection of the disease, which is crucial for
preventing its spread and optimizing patient outcomes. Owing to the limited
testing capacity in resource-strapped settings and the limitations of the
available traditional methods of testing, it has been established that a fast
and efficient strategy is important to fully stop the virus. Machine learning
models can analyze large datasets, incorporating patient-reported symptoms,
clinical data, and medical imaging. Symptom-based detection methods have been
developed to predict COVID-19, and they have shown promising results. In this
paper, we provide an overview of the landscape of symptoms-only machine
learning models for predicting COVID-19, including their performance and

deaths per year in the United States. Forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI)
-- a surrogate for the proportion of patients infected with influenza --
support public health decision making. The goal of an ensemble forecast of ILI
is to increase accuracy and calibration compared to individual forecasts and to
provide a single, cohesive prediction of future influenza. However, an ensemble
may be composed of models that produce similar forecasts, causing issues with
ensemble forecast performance and non-identifiability. To improve upon the
above issues we propose a novel Cluster-Aggregate-Pool or `CAP' ensemble
algorithm that first clusters together individual forecasts, aggregates
individual models that belong to the same cluster into a single forecast
(called a cluster forecast), and then pools together cluster forecasts via a
linear pool. When compared to a non-CAP approach, we find that a CAP ensemble
improves calibration by approximately 10% while maintaining similar accuracy to
non-CAP alternatives. In addition, our CAP algorithm (i) generalizes past
ensemble work associated with influenza forecasting and introduces a framework
for future ensemble work, (ii) automatically accounts for missing forecasts
from individual models, (iii) allows public health officials to participate in
the ensemble by assigning individual models to clusters, and (iv) provide an
additional signal about when peak influenza may be near.

parameter optimization 3. Deep learning based prediction of the model

epidemic. So, we estimate the model parameters periodically (weekly). We use
PSO to identify the optimum values of the model parameters. We next train the
stacked-LSTM on the optimized parameters, and perform forecasting of the model
parameters for upcoming four weeks. Further, we fed the LSTM forecasted
parameters into the SIRD model to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases. We

application. Furthermore, the applications are of great societal importance,
including problems such as probabilistic weather forecasting and prediction of
epidemics. Particle filters provide a well-founded approach to the problem,
leading to provably accurate approximations of the statistics. However these
methods perform poorly in high dimensions. In 1994 the idea of ensemble Kalman
filtering was introduced by Evensen, leading to a methodology that has been
widely adopted in the geophysical sciences and also finds application to quite
general inverse problems. However, ensemble Kalman filters have defied rigorous
analysis of their statistical accuracy, except in the linear Gaussian setting.
In this article we describe recent work which takes first steps to analyze the
statistical accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters beyond the linear Gaussian
setting. The subject is inherently technical, as it involves the evolution of
probability measures according to a nonlinear and nonautonomous dynamical
system; and the approximation of this evolution. It can nonetheless be

CAPTURE (direCted flAg laPlacian Transformer for drUg Resistance prEdictions)

comprehensive mutation analysis with a resistance prediction module based on
DFFormer-seq, which is a novel ensemble model that leverages a new Directed
Flag Transformer and sequence embeddings from the protein and
small-molecule-large-language models. Our analysis of the evolution of Mpro
mutations revealed a progressive increase in mutation frequencies for residues
near the binding site between May and December 2022, suggesting that the
widespread use of PAXLOVID created a selective pressure that accelerated the
evolution of drug-resistant variants. Applied to mutations at the

mutations, including H172Y and F140L, which have been experimentally confirmed,

about the mpox outbreak where ground truth data are now available. Individual
human judgment forecasts and an equally weighted ensemble were evaluated, as
well as compared to a random walk, autoregressive, and doubling time model. We
found (1) individual human judgment forecasts underestimated outbreak size, (2)
the ensemble forecast median moved closer to the ground truth over time but
uncertainty around the median did not appreciably decrease, and (3) compared to
computational models, for 2-8 week ahead forecasts, the human judgment ensemble
outperformed all three models when using median absolute error and weighted
interval score; for one week ahead forecasts a random walk outperformed human
judgment. We propose two possible explanations: at the time a forecast was
submitted, the mode was correlated with the most recent (and smaller)
observation that would eventually determine ground truth. Several forecasts
were solicited on a logarithmic scale which may have caused humans to generate
forecasts with unintended, large uncertainty intervals. To aide in outbreak
preparedness, platforms that solicit human judgment forecasts may wish to
assess whether specifying a forecast on logarithmic scale matches an
individual's intended forecast, support human judgment by finding cues that are
typically used to build forecasts, and, to improve performance, tailor their
platform to allow forecasters to assign zero probability to events.

Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to simulate
infectious disease dynamics across geographic regions. By leveraging the
spatial detail of PDEs and the computational efficiency of ODEs, the model
enables rapid evaluation of public health interventions. Applied to synthetic
environments and real-world scenarios in Lombardy, Italy, and Berlin, Germany,
the model highlights how interactions between PDE and ODE regions affect
infection dynamics, especially in high-density areas. Key findings reveal that
the placement of model boundaries in densely populated regions can lead to
inaccuracies in infection spread, suggesting that boundaries should be
positioned in areas of lower population density to better reflect transmission
dynamics. Additionally, regions with low population density hinder infection
flow, indicating a need for incorporating, e.g., jumps in the model to enhance
its predictive capabilities. Results indicate that the hybrid model achieves a
balance between computational speed and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for

  Multi-Scenario Bi-GRU Networks","  Despite numerous research efforts in applying deep learning to time series
forecasting, achieving high accuracy in multi-step predictions for volatile
time series like crude oil prices remains a significant challenge. Moreover,
most existing approaches primarily focus on one-step forecasting, and the
performance often varies depending on the dataset and specific case study. In
this paper, we introduce an ensemble model to capture Brent oil price
volatility and enhance the multi-step prediction. Our methodology employs a
two-pronged approach. First, we assess popular deep-learning models and the
impact of various external factors on forecasting accuracy. Then, we introduce
an ensemble multi-step forecasting model for Brent oil prices. Our approach
generates accurate forecasts by employing ensemble techniques across multiple
forecasting scenarios using three BI-GRU networks.Extensive experiments were
conducted on a dataset encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic period, which had a
significant impact on energy markets. The proposed model's performance was
evaluated using the standard evaluation metrics of MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The
results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms benchmark and
established models.

  predictions","  Over the last ten years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has organized an annual influenza forecasting challenge with the
motivation that accurate probabilistic forecasts could improve situational
awareness and yield more effective public health actions. Starting with the
2021/22 influenza season, the forecasting targets for this challenge have been
based on hospital admissions reported in the CDC's National Healthcare Safety
Network (NHSN) surveillance system. Reporting of influenza hospital admissions
through NHSN began within the last few years, and as such only a limited amount
of historical data are available for this signal. To produce forecasts in the
presence of limited data for the target surveillance system, we augmented these
data with two signals that have a longer historical record: 1) ILI+, which
estimates the proportion of outpatient doctor visits where the patient has
influenza; and 2) rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations at a
selected set of healthcare facilities. Our model, Flusion, is an ensemble that
combines gradient boosting quantile regression models with a Bayesian
autoregressive model. The gradient boosting models were trained on all three
data signals, while the autoregressive model was trained on only the target
signal; all models were trained jointly on data for multiple locations. Flusion
was the top-performing model in the CDC's influenza prediction challenge for
the 2023/24 season. In this article we investigate the factors contributing to
Flusion's success, and we find that its strong performance was primarily driven
by the use of a gradient boosting model that was trained jointly on data from
multiple surveillance signals and locations. These results indicate the value
of sharing information across locations and surveillance signals, especially
when doing so adds to the pool of available training data.

Recently, it has been shown that these models typically exhibit trajectories'
degeneracy, as different sets of epidemiological parameters yield comparable
predictions at early stages of the outbreak but disparate future epidemic
scenarios. Here we use the Doi-Peliti approach and extend the classical
deterministic SIS and SIR models to a quantum-like formalism to explore whether
the uncertainty of epidemic forecasts is also shaped by the stochastic nature
of epidemic processes. This approach allows getting a probabilistic ensemble of
trajectories, revealing that epidemic uncertainty is not uniform across time,
being maximal around the epidemic peak and vanishing at both early and very
late stages of the outbreak. Our results therefore show that, independently of
the models' complexity, the stochasticity of contagion and recover processes
poses a natural constraint for the uncertainty of epidemic forecasts.

  Implications of underlying assumptions for numerical solutions","  In order to simulate the spread of infectious diseases, many epidemiological
models use systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the
underlying dynamics. These models incorporate the implicit assumption, that the
stay time in each disease state follows an exponential distribution. However, a
substantial number of epidemiological, data-based studies indicate that this
assumption is not plausible. One method to alleviate this limitation is to
employ the Linear Chain Trick (LCT) for ODE systems, which realizes the use of
Erlang distributed stay times. As indicated by data, this approach allows for
more realistic models while maintaining the advantages of using ODEs.
  In this work, we propose an advanced LCT SECIR-type model incorporating eight
infection states with demographic stratification. We review key properties of
the corresponding LCT model and demonstrate that predictions derived from a
simple ODE-based model can be significantly distorted, potentially leading to
wrong political decisions. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of
distribution assumptions on the behavior at change points and on the prediction
of epidemic peaks is substantial, while the assumption has no effect on the
final size of the epidemic. With respect to prior findings in literature, we
demonstrate that the influence of the number of subcompartments on the timing
and size of the epidemic peak is nontrivial and that a general statement cannot
be obtained. We, then, show how these age-resolved LCT SECIR-type models
capture the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in 2020. Eventually, we study the
implications on the time-to-solution for different LCT models using fixed and
adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta methods and provide computational performance

disease aggregates or singular disease types. However, given differences in the
dynamics of individual diseases, it is unlikely that any single forecasting
model would accurately account for each disease and for all time, leading to
significant forecast model uncertainty. Yet, forecasting models for ED
admissions to-date do not explore the utility of forecast combinations to
improve forecast accuracy and stability. It is also unknown whether
improvements in forecast accuracy can be yield from (1) incorporating a large
number of environmental and anthropogenic covariates or (2) forecasting total
ED causes by aggregating cause-specific ED forecasts. To address this gap, we
propose high-dimensional forecast combination schemes to combine a large number
of forecasting individual models for forecasting cause-specific ED admissions

admissions with an extensive set of explanatory lagged variables at the
national level, including meteorological/ambient air pollutant variables and ED
admissions of all 16 causes studied. We show that the simple forecast
combinations yield forecast accuracies of around 3.81%-23.54% across causes.
Furthermore, forecast combinations outperform individual forecasting models, in
more than 50% of scenarios (across all ED admission categories and horizons) in
a statistically significant manner. Inclusion of high-dimensional covariates
and aggregating cause-specific forecasts to provide all-cause ED forecasts
provided modest improvements in forecast accuracy. Forecasting cause-specific

2505.04306v1,2025-05-07 10:29:39,2025-05-07 10:29:39,MoDE: Mixture of Diffusion Experts for Any Occluded Face Recognition,"  With the continuous impact of epidemics, people have become accustomed to
wearing masks. However, most current occluded face recognition (OFR) algorithms
lack prior knowledge of occlusions, resulting in poor performance when dealing
with occluded faces of varying types and severity in reality. Recognizing
occluded faces is still a significant challenge, which greatly affects the
convenience of people's daily lives. In this paper, we propose an
identity-gated mixture of diffusion experts (MoDE) for OFR. Each
diffusion-based generative expert estimates one possible complete image for
occluded faces. Considering the random sampling process of the diffusion model,
which introduces inevitable differences and variations between the inpainted
faces and the real ones. To ensemble effective information from
multi-reconstructed faces, we introduce an identity-gating network to evaluate
the contribution of each reconstructed face to the identity and adaptively
integrate the predictions in the decision space. Moreover, our MoDE is a
plug-and-play module for most existing face recognition models. Extensive
experiments on three public face datasets and two datasets in the wild validate
our advanced performance for various occlusions in comparison with the
competing methods.

  COVID-19 Hospitalization Forecasting","  The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.
