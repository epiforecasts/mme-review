  TITLE = {Influenza forecasting for the French regions by using EHR, web and climatic data sources with an ensemble approach ARGONet},
  ABSTRACT = {Effective and timely disease surveillance systems have the potential to help public health officials design interventions to mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks. Currently, healthcare-based disease monitoring systems in France offer influenza activity information that lags real-time by 1 to 3 weeks. This temporal data gap introduces uncertainty that prevents public health officials from having a timely perspective on the population-level disease activity. Here, we present a machine-learning modeling approach that produces real-time estimates and short-term forecasts of influenza activity for the 12 continental regions of France by leveraging multiple disparate data sources that include, Google search activity, real-time and local weather information, flu-related Twitter micro-blogs, electronic health records data, and historical disease activity synchronicities across regions. Our results show that all data sources contribute to improving influenza surveillance and that machine-learning ensembles that combine all data sources lead to accurate and timely predictions.

Author summaryThe role of public health is to protect the health of populations by providing the right intervention to the right population at the right time. In France and all around the world, Influenza is a major public health problem. Traditional surveillance systems produce estimates of influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rates, but with one-to three-week delay. Accurate real-time monitoring systems of influenza outbreaks could be useful for public health decisions. By combining different data sources and different statistical models, we propose an accurate and timely forecasting platform to track the flu in France at a spatial resolution that, to our knowledge, has not been explored before.},

  TITLE = {Short-term forecasts and long-term mitigation evaluations for the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province, China},
  ABSTRACT = {As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.},

  TITLE = {Analysing and comparing the COVID-19 data: The closed cases of Hubei and South Korea, the dark March in Europe, the beginning of the outbreak in South America},
  ABSTRACT = {The present work is a statistical analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubeis data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the -factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America.

MethodsBy dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient ( factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available.

FindingsThe data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development.

InterpretationThe analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The  factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.

  TITLE = {Is the impact of social distancing on coronavirus growth rates effective across different settings? A non-parametric and local regression approach to test and compare the growth rate},
  ABSTRACT = {Epidemiologists use mathematical models to predict epidemic trends, and these results are inherently uncertain when parameters are unknown or changing. In other contexts, such as climate, modellers use multi-model ensembles to inform their decision-making: when forecasts align, modellers can be more certain. This paper looks at a sub-set of alternative epidemiological models that focus on the growth rate, and it cautions against relying on the method proposed in (Pike & Saini, 2020): relying on the data for China to calculate future trajectories is likely to be subject to overfitting, a common problem in financial and economic modelling. This paper finds, surprisingly, that the data for China are double-exponential, not exponential; and that different countries are showing a range of different trajectories. The paper proposes using non-parametric and local regression methods to support epidemiologists and policymakers in assessing the relative effectiveness of social distancing policies.

  ABSTRACT = {Hawkes processes are used in machine learning for event clustering and causal inference, while they also can be viewed as stochastic versions of popular compartmental models used in epidemiology. Here we show how to develop accurate models of COVID-19 transmission using Hawkes processes with spatial-temporal covariates. We model the conditional intensity of new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. at the county level, estimating the dynamic reproduction number of the virus within an EM algorithm through a regression on Google mobility indices and demographic covariates in the maximization step. We validate the approach on short-term forecasting tasks, showing that the Hawkes process outperforms several benchmark models currently used to track the pandemic, including an ensemble approach and a SEIR-variant. We also investigate which covariates and mobility indices are most important for building forecasts of COVID-19 in the U.S.},

  TITLE = {Long-range local influenza forecasts via distributed syndromic monitoring: preliminary results},
  ABSTRACT = {Forecasting influenza primes public health systems to respond, reducing transmission, morbidity and mortality. Most influenza forecasts to date have, by necessity, relied on spatially course-grained data (e.g. state-or country-level incidence), and have operated at time horizons of 12 weeks or less. If influenza outbreaks could be predicted farther in advance and with increased spatial precision, then limited public health resources could be adaptively managed to minimize spread and improve health outcomes. Here, we use real-time syndromic data from a distributed network of thermometers to construct city-specific forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI) with a horizon of 30 weeks. Daily geolocated ILI data from the network allows for estimates of recurrent city-specific patterns in ILI transmission rates. These "transmission templates" are used to parameterize an ensemble of ILI forecasts that differ randomly in three parameters, representing city- and season-specific rates of susceptible depletion and reporting, as well as differences in influenza season onset timing. For nine cities across the US, the best-in-hindsight model matches the observed data, and the best forecast variants can be identified in the early season.},

  TITLE = {Artificial Intelligence Predicts and Explains West Nile Virus Risks Across Europe: Extraordinary Outbreaks Determined by Climate and Local Factors},
  ABSTRACT = {Year-to-year emergence of West Nile virus has been sporadic and notoriously hard to predict. In Europe, 2018 saw a dramatic increase in the number of cases and locations affected. In this work, we demonstrate a novel method for predicting outbreaks and understanding what drives them. This method creates a simple model for each region that directly explains how each variable affects risk. Behind the scenes, each local explanation model is produced by a state-of-the-art AI engine. This engine unpacks and restructures output from an XGBoost machine learning ensemble. XGBoost, well-known for its predictive accuracy, has always been considered a "black box" system. Not any more. With only minimal data curation and no "tuning", our model predicted where the 2018 outbreak would occur with an AUC of 97%. This model was trained using data from 2010-2016 that reflected many domains of knowledge. Climate, sociodemographic, economic, and biodiversity data were all included. Our model furthermore explained the specific drivers of the 2018 outbreak for each affected region. These effect predictions were found to be consistent with the research literature in terms of priority, direction, magnitude, and size of effect. Aggregation and statistical analysis of local effects revealed strong cross-scale interactions. From this, we concluded that the 2018 outbreak was driven by large-scale climatic anomalies enhancing the local effect of mosquito vectors. We also identified substantial areas across Europe at risk for sudden outbreak, similar to that experienced in 2018. Taken as a whole, these findings highlight the role of climate in the emergence and transmission of West Nile virus. Furthermore, they demonstrate the crucial role that the emerging "eXplainable AI" (XAI) paradigm will have in predicting and controlling disease.

HighlightsO_LIThis study shows that the extraordinary 2018 West Nile virus outbreak in Europe was likely due to cross-scale effects between large climatic systems and local mosquito vector populations
C_LIO_LIWe found that large areas in Europe are similarly vulnerable to large and sudden outbreaks
C_LIO_LIThese findings were powered by a novel AI-driven engine for deriving locally precise models; this explanatory engine was supported by a high-performance XGBoost model (97% AUC).
C_LIO_LIAI-driven local models allow for high-power statistical analyses, including: hypothesis testing,, standardized effect size calculation, multivariate clustering, and tertiary inferential modeling

  TITLE = {Ensemble Forecasts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S.},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has driven demand for forecasts to guide policy and planning. Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single "ensemble" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S.

MethodsBeginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths.

ResultsAnalysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals.

ConclusionsThis analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.},

  TITLE = {COVID-19 dynamics across the US: A deep learning study of human mobility and social behavior},
  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a deep learning framework for epidemiology system identification from noisy and sparse observations with quantified uncertainty. The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

  TITLE = {Validation of expert system enhanced deep learning algorithm for automated screening for COVID-Pneumonia on chest X-rays},
  ABSTRACT = {The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed a limitation of artificial intelligence (AI) based medical image interpretation systems. Early in the pandemic, when need was greatest, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions. Even now, there is a need for Chest-X-ray (CxR) screening tools in low and middle income countries (LMIC), when RT-PCR is delayed, to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia (Cov-Pneum) requiring transfer to higher care. In absence of local LMIC data and poor portability of CxR DL algorithms, a new approach is needed. Axiomatically, it is faster to repurpose existing data than to generate new datasets. Here, we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool which uses an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for Cov-Pneum diagnosis, trained entirely on datasets from the pre-COVID-19 period. Portability, performance, and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. First, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine-center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiologic Cov-Pneum that may require higher care. Second, a curated dataset with 434 RT-PCR positive cases of varying levels of severity and 471 historical scans containing normal studies and non-COVID pathologies, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had accuracy of 87% with negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data for Cov-Pneum. However, sensitivity varied from 0.66 to 0.90 depending on whether RT-PCR or radiologist opinion was set as ground truth. This tool with explainability feature has better performance than publicly available algorithms trained on COVID-19 data but needs further improvement.},

  TITLE = {Predicting Dengue Incidence Leveraging Internet-Based Data Sources: A Case Study in 20 cities in Brazil.},
  ABSTRACT = {The dengue virus affects millions of people every year worldwide, causing large epidemic outbreaks that disrupt peoples lives and severely strain healthcare systems. In the absence of a reliable vaccine against it or an effective treatment to manage the illness in humans, most efforts to combat dengue infections have focused on preventing its vectors, mainly the Aedes aegypti mosquito, from flourishing across the world. These mosquito-control strategies need reliable disease activity surveillance systems to be deployed. Despite significant efforts to estimate dengue incidence using a variety of data sources and methods, little work has been done to understand the relative contribution of the different data sources to improved prediction. Additionally, scholarship on the topic had initially focused on prediction systems at the national- and state-levels, and much remains to be done at the finer spatial resolutions at which health policy interventions often occur. We develop a methodological framework to assess and compare dengue incidence estimates at the city level, and evaluate the performance of a collection of models on 20 different cities in Brazil. The data sources we use towards this end are weekly incidence counts from prior years (seasonal autoregressive terms), weekly-aggregated weather variables, and real-time internet search data. We find that both random forest-based models and LASSO regression-based models effectively leverage these multiple data sources to produce accurate predictions, and that while the performance between them is comparable on average, the former method produces fewer extreme outliers, and can thus be considered more robust. For real-time predictions that assume long delays (6-8 weeks) in the availability of epidemiological data, we find that real-time internet search data are the strongest predictors of dengue incidence, whereas for predictions that assume short delays (1-3 weeks), in which the error rate is halved (as measured by relative RMSE), short-term and seasonal autocorrelation are the dominant predictors. Despite the difficulties inherent to city-level prediction, our framework achieves meaningful and actionable estimates across cities with different demographic, geographic and epidemic characteristics.

Author SummaryAs the incidence of infectious diseases like dengue continues to increase throughout the world, tracking their spread in real time poses a significant challenge to local and national health authorities. Accurate incidence data are often difficult to obtain as outbreaks emerge and unfold, both due the partial reach of serological surveillance (especially in rural areas), and due to delays in reporting, which result in post-hoc adjustments to what should have been real-time data. Thus, a range of  nowcasting tools have been developed to estimate disease trends, using different mathematical and statistical methodologies to fill the temporal data gap. Over the past several years, researchers have investigated how to best incorporate internet search data into predictive models, since these can be obtained in real-time. Still, most such models have been regression-based, and have tended to underperform in cases when epidemiological data are only available after long reporting delays. Moreover, in tropical countries, attention has increasingly turned from testing and applying models at the national level to models at higher spatial resolutions, such as states and cities. Here, we develop machine learning models based on both LASSO regression and on random forest ensembles, and proceed to apply and compare them across 20 cities in Brazil. We find that our methodology produces meaningful and actionable disease estimates at the city level with both underlying model classes, and that the two perform comparably across most metrics, although the ensemble method produces fewer outliers. We also compare model performance and the relative contribution of different data sources across diverse geographic, demographic and epidemic conditions.},

  TITLE = {Short-term forecasts to inform the response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundShort-term forecasts of infectious disease can aid situational awareness and planning for outbreak response. Here, we report on multi-model forecasts of Covid-19 in the UK that were generated at regular intervals starting at the end of March 2020, in order to monitor expected healthcare utilisation and population impacts in real time.

MethodsWe evaluated the performance of individual model forecasts generated between 24 March and 14 July 2020, using a variety of metrics including the weighted interval score as well as metrics that assess the calibration, sharpness, bias and absolute error of forecasts separately. We further combined the predictions from individual models into ensemble forecasts using a simple mean as well as a quantile regression average that aimed to maximise performance. We compared model performance to a null model of no change.

ResultsIn most cases, individual models performed better than the null model, and ensembles models were well calibrated and performed comparatively to the best individual models. The quantile regression average did not noticeably outperform the mean ensemble.

ConclusionsEnsembles of multi-model forecasts can inform the policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic by assessing future resource needs and expected population impact of morbidity and mortality.},

  TITLE = {Post Hoc Evaluation of Probabilistic Model Forecasts: A COVID-19 Case Study},
  ABSTRACT = {To combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), decision-makers and the public may desire forecasts of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that are likely to occur. Thankfully, dozens of COVID-19 forecasting models exist and many of their forecasts have been made publicly available. However, there has been little published peer-reviewed information regarding the performance of these models and what is available has focused mostly on the performance of their central estimates (i.e., predictive performance). There has been little reported on the accuracy of their uncertainty estimates (i.e., probabilistic performance), which could inform users how often they would be surprised by observations outside forecasted confidence intervals. To address this gap in knowledge, we borrow from the literature on formally elicited expert judgment to demonstrate one commonly used approach for resolving this issue. For two distinct periods of the pandemic, we applied the Classical Model (CM) to evaluate probabilistic model performance and constructed a performance-weighted ensemble based on this evaluation. Some models which exhibited good predictive performance were found to have poor probabilistic performance, and vice versa. Only two of the nine models considered exhibited superior predictive and probabilistic performance. Additionally, the CM-weighted ensemble outperformed the equal-weighted and predictive-weighted ensembles. With its limited scope, this study does not provide definitive conclusions on model performance. Rather, it highlights the evaluation methodology and indicates the utility associated with using the CM when assessing probabilistic performance and constructing high performing ensembles, not only for COVID-19 modeling but other applications as well.

Significance StatementCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forecasting models can provide critical information for decision-makers and the public. Unfortunately, little information on their performance has been published, particularly regarding the accuracy of their uncertainty estimates (i.e., probabilistic performance). To address this research gap, we demonstrate the Classical Model (CM), a commonly used approach from the literature on formally elicited expert judgment, which considers both the tightness of forecast confidence intervals and frequency in which confidence intervals contain the observation. Two models exhibited superior performance and the CM-based ensemble consistently outperformed the other constructed ensembles. While these results are not definitive, they highlight the evaluation methodology and indicate the value associated with using the CM when assessing probabilistic performance and constructing high performing ensembles.},

  TITLE = {Evaluation of individual and ensemble probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the US},
  ABSTRACT = {Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 90 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. A multi-model ensemble forecast that combined predictions from dozens of different research groups every week provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through October 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete forecasts of COVID-19 deaths consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Two-thirds of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naive baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-week horizon 3-5 times larger than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.

Significance StatementThis paper compares the probabilistic accuracy of short-term forecasts of reported deaths due to COVID-19 during the first year and a half of the pandemic in the US. Results show high variation in accuracy between and within stand-alone models, and more consistent accuracy from an ensemble model that combined forecasts from all eligible models. This demonstrates that an ensemble model provided a reliable and comparatively accurate means of forecasting deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic that exceeded the performance of all of the models that contributed to it. This work strengthens the evidence base for synthesizing multiple models to support public health action.},

  TITLE = {Trade-offs between individual and ensemble forecasts of an emerging infectious disease},
  ABSTRACT = {When new pathogens emerge, numerous questions arise about their future spread, some of which can be addressed with probabilistic forecasts. The many uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging pathogens can make it difficult to choose among model structures and assumptions, however. To assess the potential for uncertainties about emerging pathogens to affect forecasts of their spread, we evaluated the performance of a suite of 16 forecasting models in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia. Each model featured a different combination of assumptions about the role of human mobility in driving transmission, spatiotemporal variation in transmission potential, and the number of times the virus was introduced. All models used the same core transmission model and the same iterative data assimilation algorithm to generate forecasts. By assessing forecast performance through time using logarithmic scoring with ensemble weighting, we found that which model assumptions had the most ensemble weight changed through time. In particular, spatially coupled models had higher ensemble weights in the early and late phases of the epidemic, whereas non-spatial models had higher ensemble weights at the peak of the epidemic. We compared forecast performance of the equally weighted ensemble model to each individual model and identified a trade-off whereby certain individual models outperformed the ensemble model early in the epidemic but the ensemble model outperformed all individual models on average. On balance, our results suggest that suites of models that span uncertainty across alternative assumptions are necessary to obtain robust forecasts in the context of emerging infectious diseases.},

  TITLE = {FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES AND SARS-COV-2-MULTI-POPULATION MODELING WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF DISPARITY BY RACE/ETHNICITY USING ENSEMBLE DATA ASSIMILATION},
  ABSTRACT = {AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic has imposed many strenuous effects on the global economy, community, and medical infrastructure. Since the out- break, researchers and policymakers have scrambled to develop ways to identify how COVID-19 will affect specific sub-populations so that good public health decisions can be made. To this end, we adapt the work of Evensen et al [1] which introduces a SEIR model that incorporates an age-stratified contact matrix, a time dependent effective reproduction number R, and uses ensemble data assimilation to estimate model parameters. The adaptation is an extension of Evensens modeling framework, in which we model sub-populations with varying risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in a particular state, each with a characteristic age-stratified contact matrix. In this work, we will focus on 9 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia. We estimate the effective reproductive number as a function of time for our different sub-populations and then divide them into two groups: frontline communities (FLCs) and the complement (NFLCs). Our model will account for mixing both within populations (intra-population mixing) and between populations (inter-population mixing). Our data is conditioned on the daily numbers of accumulated deaths for each sub-population. We aim to test and demonstrate methodologies that can be used to assess critical metrics of the pandemics evolution which are difficult to directly measure. The output may ultimately be of use to measure the success or failures of the pandemic response and provide experts and policymakers a tool to create better plans for a future outbreak or pandemic. We consider the results of this work to be a reanalysis of pandemic evolution across differently affected sub-populations which may also be used to improve modeling and forecasts.},

  TITLE = {All Models Are Useful: Bayesian Ensembling for Robust High Resolution COVID-19 Forecasting},
  ABSTRACT = {Timely, high-resolution forecasts of infectious disease incidence are useful for policy makers in deciding intervention measures and estimating healthcare resource burden. In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our models performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response.

  ABSTRACT = {AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is disrupting all aspects of our lives as the global spread of the virus continues. In this difficult period, various research projects are taking place to study and analyse the dynamics of the pandemic. In the present work, we firstly present a deep overview of the main forecasting models to predict the new cases of COVID-19. In this context, we focus on univariate time series models in order to analyze the dynamic change of this pandemic through time. We secondly shed light on multivariate time series forecasting models using weather and daily tests data, to study the impact of exogenous features on the progression of COVID-19. In the final stage of this paper, we present our proposed approach based on LSTM and GRU ensemble learning model and evaluate the results using the MAE, RMSE and MAPE for the prediction of new cases. The results of our experiments using the Canadian dataset show that the ensemble model performs well in comparison to other models. In addition, this research provides us with a new outcome regarding the dynamic correlation between temperature, humidity and daily test data and its impact on the new contaminated cases.},

  TITLE = {A random forest model for forecasting regional COVID-19 cases utilizing reproduction number estimates and demographic data},
  ABSTRACT = {AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, predicting case spikes at the local level is important for a precise, targeted public health response and is generally done with compartmental models. The performance of compartmental models is highly dependent on the accuracy of their assumptions about disease dynamics within a population; thus, such models are susceptible to human error, unexpected events, or unknown characteristics of a novel infectious agent like COVID-19. We present a relatively non-parametric random forest model that forecasts the number of COVID-19 cases at the U.S. county level. Its most prioritized training features are derived from easily accessible, standard epidemiological data (i.e., regional test positivity rate) and the effective reproduction number (Rt) from compartmental models. A novel input training feature is case projections generated by aligning estimated effective reproduction number (pre-computed by COVIDActNow.org) with real time testing data until maximally correlated, helping our model fit better to the epidemics trajectory as ascertained by traditional models. Poor reliability of Rt is partially mitigated with dynamic population mobility and prevalence and mortality of non-COVID-19 diseases to gauge population disease susceptibility. The model was used to generate forecasts for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks into the future for each reference week within 11/01/2020 - 01/10/2021 for 3068 counties. Over this time period, it maintained a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 300 weekly cases/100,000 and consistently outperformed or performed comparably with gold-standard compartmental models. Furthermore, it holds great potential in ensemble modeling due to its potential for a more expansive training feature set while maintaining good performance and limited resource utilization.},

  TITLE = {Forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative COVID-19 mortality in the United States: A comparison of combining methods},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundForecasting models have played a pivotal role in health policy decision making during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A combined forecast from multiple models will be typically more accurate than an individual forecast, but there are few examples of studies of combined forecasts of COVID-19 data, focusing mainly on simple mean and median  ensembles and involving short forecast evaluation periods. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of different ways of combining probabilistic forecasts of weekly COVID-19 mortality data, including two weighted methods that we developed previously, on an extended dataset and new dataset, and evaluate over a period of 52 weeks.

MethodsWe considered 95% interval and point forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative COVID-19 mortalities between 16 May 2020 and 8 May 2021 in multiple locations in the United States. We compared the accuracy of simple and more complex combining methods, as well as individual models.

ResultsThe average of the forecasts from the individual models was consistently more accurate than the average performance of these models (the mean combination), which provides a fundamental motivation for combining. Weighted combining performed well for both incident and cumulative mortalities, and for both interval and point forecasting. Our inverse score with tuning method was the most accurate overall. The median combination was a leading method in the last quarter for both mortalities, and it was consistently more accurate than the mean combination for point forecasting. For interval forecasts of cumulative mortality, the mean performed better than the median. The best performance of the leading individual model was in point forecasting.

ConclusionsCombining forecasts can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting to health policy decision making during epidemics, and, when there are sufficient historical data on forecast accuracy, weighted combining provides the most accurate method.},

  TITLE = {Predicting future ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection prevalence using serological, clinical, molecular, and geospatial data},
  ABSTRACT = {Trachoma is an infectious disease characterized by repeated exposures to Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) that may ultimately lead to blindness. District-level estimates of clinical disease are currently used to guide control programs. However, clinical trachoma is a subjective indicator. Serological markers present an objective, scalable alternative for monitoring and targeting of more intensive control efforts. We hypothesized that IgG seroprevalence in combination with geospatial layers, machine learning, and model-based geostatistics would be able to accurately predict future community-level ocular Ct infections detected by PCR. Among 40 communities in the hyperendemic Amhara region of Ethiopia, median Ct infection prevalence among children 0-5 years old increased from 6% at enrollment to 29% at month 36. Seroprevalence was the strongest concurrent predictor of infection prevalence at month 36 among children 0-5 years old (cross-validated R2 = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.85), though predictive performance declined substantially with increasing temporal lag between predictor and outcome measurements. Geospatial variables, a spatial Gaussian process, and stacked ensemble machine learning did not meaningfully improve predictions. Serological markers among children 0-5 years old may be a promising programmatic tool for identifying communities with high levels of active ocular Ct infections, but accurate, future prediction in the context of changing transmission remains a challenge.},

  ABSTRACT = {Short-term forecasts of the dynamics of COVID-19 in the period up to its decline following mass vaccination was a task that received much attention but proved difficult to do with high accuracy. However, the availability of standardized forecasts and versioned data sets from this period allows for continued work in this area. Here we introduce the Gaussian Infection State Space with Time-dependence (GISST) forecasting model. We evaluate its performance in 1-4 week ahead forecasts of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths in the state of California made with official reports of COVID-19, Googles mobility reports, and vaccination data available each week. Evaluation of these forecasts with a weighted interval score shows them to consistently outperform a naive baseline forecast and often score closer to or better than a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of COVID-19 dynamics, includes a regression submodel for the transmission rate, and allows for parameters to vary over time according to a random walk. GISST provides a novel, balanced combination of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and applicability to large multivariate data sets that may prove useful in improving the accuracy of infectious disease forecasts.},

In response, models were developed to help predict the course of various disease metrics, and these models have been relied upon to help guide public health policy. Here we present a method called COVIDNearTerm to "forecast" hospitalizations in the short term, two to four weeks from the time of prediction. COVIDNearTerm is based on an autoregressive model and utilizes a parametric bootstrap approach to make predictions. We evaluated COVIDNearTerm on San Francisco Bay Area hospitalizations and compared it to models from the California COVID Assessment Tool (CalCAT). We found that that COVIDNearTerm pre-dictions were more accurate than the CalCAT ensemble predictions for all comparisons and any CalCAT component for a majority of comparisons. For instance, at the county level our 14-day hospitalization median absolute percentage errors ranged from 16% to 36%. For those same comparisons the CalCAT ensemble errors were between 30% and 59%. COVIDNearT-erm is also easier to use than some other methods. It requires only previous hospitalization data and there is an open source R package that implements the algorithm.},

  TITLE = {Comparing human and model-based forecasts of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland},
  ABSTRACT = {1Forecasts based on epidemiological modelling have played an important role in shaping public policy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This modelling combines knowledge about infectious disease dynamics with the subjective opinion of the researcher who develops and refines the model and often also adjusts model outputs. Developing a forecast model is difficult, resource- and time-consuming. It is therefore worth asking what modelling is able to add beyond the subjective opinion of the researcher alone. To investigate this, we analysed different real-time forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland over a 1-4 week horizon submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub. We compared crowd forecasts elicited from researchers and volunteers, against a) forecasts from two semi-mechanistic models based on common epidemiological assumptions and b) the ensemble of all other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We found crowd forecasts, despite being overconfident, to outperform all other methods across all forecast horizons when forecasting cases (weighted interval score relative to the Hub ensemble 2 weeks ahead: 0.89). Forecasts based on computational models performed comparably better when predicting deaths (rel. WIS 1.26), suggesting that epidemiological modelling and human judgement can complement each other in important ways.},

  TITLE = {Accuracy of US CDC COVID-19 Forecasting Models},
  ABSTRACT = {Accurate predictive modeling of pandemics is essential for optimally distributing resources and setting policy. Dozens of case predictions models have been proposed but their accuracy over time and by model type remains unclear. In this study, we analyze all US CDC COVID-19 forecasting models, by first categorizing them and then calculating their mean absolute percent error, both wave-wise and on the complete timeline. We compare their estimates to government-reported case numbers, one another, as well as two baseline models wherein case counts remain static or follow a simple linear trend. The comparison reveals that more than one-third of models fail to outperform a simple static case baseline and two-thirds fail to outperform a simple linear trend forecast. A wave-by-wave comparison of models revealed that no overall modeling approach was superior to others, including ensemble models, and error in modeling has increased over time during the pandemic. This study raises concerns about hosting these models on official public platforms of health organizations including the US-CDC which risks giving them an official imprimatur and further raising concerns if utilized to formulate policy. By offering a universal evaluation method for pandemic forecasting models, we expect this work to serve as the starting point towards the development of more accurate models.},

  TITLE = {Predictive performance of multi-model ensemble forecasts of COVID-19 across European nations},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundShort-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to situational awareness and aid capacity planning. Based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and 07 March 2022.

MethodsWe used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to four weeks. Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised quantiles of the predictive distribution. Each week we created an ensemble forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the median) of all individual models predictive quantiles. We measured the performance of each model using the relative Weighted Interval Score (WIS), comparing models forecast accuracy relative to all other models. We retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts, including weighted averages based on models past predictive performance.

ResultsOver 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32 countries. We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance across countries over time. Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble performed better on relative WIS than 84% of participating models forecasts of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92% of participating models forecasts of deaths (N=746). Across a one to four week time horizon, ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts. In every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently outperforming all of its individual component models. Among several choices of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of methods of weighting component forecast models.

ConclusionsOur results support the use of combining forecasts from individual models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics. Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better predictive performance more than ones based on means. Our findings also highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than two weeks.

  TITLE = {An ensemble n-sub-epidemic modeling framework for short-term forecasting epidemic trajectories: Application to the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA},
  ABSTRACT = {We analyze an ensemble of n-sub-epidemic modeling for forecasting the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics. These ensemble modeling approaches, and models that integrate sub-epidemics to capture complex temporal dynamics, have demonstrated powerful forecasting capability. This modeling framework can characterize complex epidemic patterns, including plateaus, epidemic resurgences, and epidemic waves characterized by multiple peaks of different sizes. We systematically assess their calibration and short-term forecasting performance in short-term forecasts for the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA from late April 2020 to late February 2022. We compare their performance with two commonly used statistical ARIMA models. The best fit sub-epidemic model and three ensemble models constructed using the top-ranking sub-epidemic models consistently outperformed the ARIMA models in terms of the weighted interval score (WIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval across the 10-, 20-, and 30-day short-term forecasts. In the 30-day forecasts, the average WIS ranged from 377.6 to 421.3 for the sub-epidemic models, whereas it ranged from 439.29 to 767.05 for the ARIMA models. Across 98 short-term forecasts, the ensemble model incorporating the top four ranking sub-epidemic models (Ensemble(4)) outperformed the (log) ARIMA model 66.3% of the time, and the ARIMA model 69.4% of the time in 30-day ahead forecasts in terms of the WIS. Ensemble(4) consistently yielded the best performance in terms of the metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions. This framework could be readily applied to investigate the spread of epidemics and pandemics beyond COVID-19, as well as other dynamic growth processes found in nature and society that would benefit from short-term predictions.

SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to develop reliable tools to forecast the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics in near real-time. We describe and apply an ensemble n-sub-epidemic modeling framework for forecasting the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics. We systematically assess its calibration and short-term forecasting performance in weekly 10-30 days ahead forecasts for the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA from late April 2020 to late February 2022 and compare its performance with two different statistical ARIMA models. This framework demonstrated reliable forecasting performance and substantially outcompeted the ARIMA models. The forecasting performance was consistently best for the ensemble sub-epidemic models incorporating a higher number of top-ranking sub-epidemic models. The ensemble model incorporating the top four ranking sub-epidemic models consistently yielded the best performance, particularly in terms of the coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval and the weighted interval score. This framework can be applied to forecast other growth processes found in nature and society including the spread of information through social media.},

  TITLE = {Forecasting COVID-19 activity in Australia to support pandemic response: May to October 2020},
  ABSTRACT = {As of January 2021, Australia had effectively controlled local transmission of COVID-19 despite a steady influx of imported cases and several local, but contained, outbreaks in 2020. Throughout 2020, state and territory public health responses were informed by weekly situational reports that included an ensemble forecast for each jurisdiction. We present here an analysis of one forecasting model included in this ensemble across the variety of scenarios experienced by each jurisdiction from May to October 2020. We examine how successfully the forecasts characterised future case incidence, subject to variations in data timeliness and completeness, showcase how we adapted these forecasts to support decisions of public health priority in rapidly-evolving situations, evaluate the impact of key model features on forecast skill, and demonstrate how to assess forecast skill in real-time before the ground truth is known. Conditioning the model on the most recent, but incomplete, data improved the forecast skill, emphasising the importance of developing strong quantitative models of surveillance system characteristics, such as ascertainment delay distributions. Forecast skill was highest when there were at least 10 reported cases per day, the circumstances in which authorities were most in need of forecasts to aid in planning and response.},

  TITLE = {A Deep Learning Approach to Forecast Short-Term COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US},
  ABSTRACT = {Since the US reported its first COVID-19 case on January 21, 2020, the science community has been applying various techniques to forecast incident cases and deaths. To date, providing an accurate and robust forecast at a high spatial resolution has proved challenging, even in the short term. Here we present a novel multi-stage deep learning model to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US state at a weekly level for a forecast horizon of 1 to 4 weeks. The model is heavily data driven, and relies on epidemiological, mobility, survey, climate, and demographic. We further present results from a case study that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 genomic data (i.e. variant cases) to demonstrate the value of incorporating variant cases data into model forecast tools. We implement a rigorous and robust evaluation of our model - specifically we report on weekly performance over a one-year period based on multiple error metrics, and explicitly assess how our model performance varies over space, chronological time, and different outbreak phases. The proposed model is shown to consistently outperform the CDC ensemble model for all evaluation metrics in multiple spatiotemporal settings, especially for the longer-term (3 and 4 weeks ahead) forecast horizon. Our case study also highlights the potential value of virus genomic data for use in short-term forecasting to identify forthcoming surges driven by new variants. Based on our findings, the proposed forecasting framework improves upon the available forecasting tools currently used to support public health decision making with respect to COVID-19 risk.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA systematic review of the COVID-19 forecasting and the EPIFORGE 2020 guidelines reveal the lack of consistency, reproducibility, comparability, and quality in the current COVID-19 forecasting literature. To provide an updated survey of the literature, we carried out our literature search on Google Scholar, PubMed, and medRxi, using the terms "Covid-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "coronavirus," "short-term," "forecasting," and "genomic surveillance." Although the literature includes a significant number of papers, it remains lacking with respect to rigorous model evaluation, interpretability and translation. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance is emerging as a vital necessity to fight COVID-19 (i.e. wastewater sampling and airport screening), to our knowledge, no published forecasting model has illustrated the value of virus genomic data for informing future outbreaks.

Added value of this studyWe propose a multi-stage deep learning model to forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths with a horizon window of four weeks. The data driven model relies on a comprehensive set of input features, including epidemiological, mobility, behavioral survey, climate, and demographic. We present a robust evaluation framework to systematically assess the model performance over a one-year time span, and using multiple error metrics. This rigorous evaluation framework reveals how the predictive accuracy varies over chronological time, space, and outbreak phase. Further, a comparative analysis against the CDC ensemble, the best performing model in the COVID-19 ForecastHub, shows the model to consistently outperform the CDC ensemble for all evaluation metrics in multiple spatiotemporal settings, especially for the longer forecasting windows. We also conduct a feature analysis, and show that the role of explanatory features changes over time. Specifically, we note a changing role of climate variables on model performance in the latter half of the study period. Lastly, we present a case study that reveals how incorporating SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data may improve forecasting accuracy compared to a model without variant cases data.

Implications of all the available evidenceResults from the robust evaluation analysis highlight extreme model performance variability over time and space, and suggest that forecasting models should be accompanied with specifications on the conditions under which they perform best (and worst), in order to maximize their value and utility in aiding public health decision making. The feature analysis reveals the complex and changing role of factors contributing to COVID-19 transmission over time, and suggests a possible seasonality effect of climate on COVID-19 spread, but only after August 2021. Finally, the case study highlights the added value of using genomic surveillance data in short-term epidemiological forecasting models, especially during the early stage of new variant introductions.},

  TITLE = {Evaluating an epidemiologically motivated surrogate model of a multi-model ensemble},
  ABSTRACT = {Multi-model and multi-team ensemble forecasts have become widely used to generate reliable short-term predictions of infectious disease spread. Notably, various public health agencies have used them to leverage academic disease modelling during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ensemble forecasts are difficult to interpret and require extensive effort from numerous participating groups as well as a coordination team. In other fields, resource usage has been reduced by training simplified models that reproduce some of the observed behaviour of more complex models. Here we used observations of the behaviour of the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble combined with our own forecasting experience to identify a set of properties present in current ensemble forecasts. We then developed a parsimonious forecast model intending to mirror these properties. We assess forecasts generated from this model in real time over six months (the 15th of January 2022 to the 19th of July 2022) and for multiple European countries. We focused on forecasts of cases one to four weeks ahead and compared them to those by the European forecast hub ensemble. We find that the surrogate model behaves qualitatively similarly to the ensemble in many instances, though with increased uncertainty and poorer performance around periods of peak incidence (as measured by the Weighted Interval Score). The performance differences, however, seem to be partially due to a subset of time points, and the proposed model appears better probabilistically calibrated than the ensemble. We conclude that our simplified forecast model may have captured some of the dynamics of the hub ensemble, but more work is needed to understand the implicit epidemiological model that it represents.},

  TITLE = {Forecasting Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) during the COVID-19 Pandemic},
  ABSTRACT = {Near-term probabilistic forecasts for infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza play an important role in public health communication and policymaking. From 2013-2019, the FluSight challenge run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention invited researchers to develop and submit forecasts using influenza-like illness (ILI) as a measure of influenza burden. Here we examine how several statistical models and an autoregressive neural network model perform for forecasting ILI during the COVID-19 pandemic, where historical patterns of ILI were highly disrupted. We find that the autoregressive neural network model which forecasted ILI well pre-COVID still performs well for some locations and forecast horizons, but its performance is highly variable, and performs poorly in many cases. We found that a simple exponential smoothing statistical model is in the top half of ranked models we evaluated nearly 75% of the time. Our results suggest that even simple statistical models may perform as well as or better than more complex machine learning models for forecasting ILI during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also created an ensemble model from the limited set of time series forecast models we created here. The limited ensemble model was rarely the best or the worst performing model compared to the rest of the models assessed, confirming previous observations from other infectious disease forecasting efforts on the less variable and generally favorable performance of ensemble forecasts. Our results support previous findings that no single modeling approach outperforms all other models across all locations, time points, and forecast horizons, and that ensemble forecasting consortia such as the COVID-19 Forecast Hub and FluSight continue to serve valuable roles in collecting, aggregating, and ensembling forecasts using fundamentally disparate modeling strategies.},

  TITLE = {Real-time forecasting the trajectory of monkeypox outbreaks at the national and global levels, July - October 2022.},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundBeginning May 7, 2022, multiple nations reported an unprecedented surge in monkeypox cases. Unlike past outbreaks, differences in affected populations, transmission mode, and clinical characteristics have been noted. With the existing uncertainties of the outbreak, real-time short-term forecasting can guide and evaluate the effectiveness of public health measures.

MethodsWe obtained publicly available data on confirmed weekly cases of monkeypox at the global level and for seven countries (with the highest burden of disease at the time this study was initiated) from the Our World in Data (OWID) GitHub repository and CDC website. We generated short-term forecasts of new cases of monkeypox across the study areas using an ensemble n-sub-epidemic modeling framework based on weekly cases using 10-week calibration periods. We report and assess the weekly forecasts with quantified uncertainty from the top-ranked, second-ranked, and ensemble sub-epidemic models. Overall, we conducted 324 weekly sequential 4-week ahead forecasts across the models from the week of July 28th, 2022, to the week of October 13th, 2022.

ResultsThe last 10 of 12 forecasting periods (starting the week of August 11th, 2022), show either a plateauing or declining trend of monkeypox cases for all models and areas of study. According to our latest 4-week ahead forecast from the top-ranked model, a total of 6232 (95% PI: 487.8, 12468.0) cases could be added globally from the week of 10/20/2022 to the week of 11/10/2022. At the country level, the top-ranked model predicts that the United States will report the highest cumulative number of new cases for the 4-week forecasts (median based on OWID data: 1806 (95% PI: 0.0, 5544.5)). The top-ranked and weighted ensemble models outperformed all other models in short-term forecasts.

ConclusionsOur top-ranked model consistently predicted a decreasing trend in monkeypox cases on the global and country-specific scale during the last ten sequential forecasting periods. Our findings reflect the potential impact of increased immunity, and behavioral modification among high-risk populations.},

  TITLE = {Assessing the accuracy of California county level COVID-19 hospitalization forecasts to inform public policy decision making},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of infectious disease forecasting in informing public policy. However, significant barriers remain for effectively linking infectious disease forecasts to public health decision making, including a lack of model validation. Forecasting model performance and accuracy should be evaluated retrospectively to understand under which conditions models were reliable and could be improved in the future.

MethodsUsing archived forecasts from the California Department of Public Healths California COVID Assessment Tool (https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov/cacovidmodels/), we compared how well different forecasting models predicted COVID-19 hospitalization census across California counties and regions during periods of Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variant predominance.

ResultsBased on mean absolute error estimates, forecasting models had variable performance across counties and through time. When accounting for model availability across counties and dates, some individual models performed consistently better than the ensemble model, but model rankings still differed across counties. Local transmission trends, variant prevalence, and county population size were informative predictors for determining which model performed best for a given county based on a random forest classification analysis. Overall, the ensemble model performed worse in less populous counties, in part because of fewer model contributors in these locations.

ConclusionsEnsemble model predictions could be improved by incorporating geographic heterogeneity in model coverage and performance. Consistency in model reporting and improved model validation can strengthen the role of infectious disease forecasting in real-time public health decision making.},

  TITLE = {Forecasting the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic into 2023 under plausible variant and intervention scenarios: a global modelling study},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundThe recent Omicron-related waves of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in unprecedented levels of population transmission due to the variants high level of infectiousness across most of the world. China, the last large country to end its "zero-COVID" policies, is currently facing its own massive Omicron-related wave, and the final impact of that wave remains uncertain. We have seen repeatedly that the epidemiological characteristics of new variants can have profound impacts on global health outcomes. While the characteristics of these new variants are difficult to predict ahead of their emergence, considering the impact of potential future scenarios is of central importance for prudent planning and policy making. This paper samples across a range of potential variant-level characteristics to provide global forecasts of infections, hospitalisations, and deaths in the face of ongoing Omicron-related transmission and waning levels of past immunity and evaluates a range of interventions that may diminish the impact of future waves.

MethodsWe created a susceptible-exposed-infectious dynamic model that accounts for vaccine uptake and effectiveness, antiviral administration, the emergence of new variants, and waning protection from both infection- and vaccine-derived immunity. Using this model, we first estimated past infections, hospitalisations, and deaths by variant, location, and day. We used these findings to more fully understand the global progression of the COVID-19 pandemic through December 12, 2022. Second, we forecasted these same outcome measures under five potential variant emergence scenarios. Third, we evaluated three different interventions in isolation and in concert within each potential variant scenario, to assess the impact of available intervention strategies through June 30, 2023.

FindingsWe estimated that from November 15, 2021, through December 12, 2022, there were 8.60 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6.37-11.7) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 13.1 million (10.6-16.5) hospitalisations, and 3.04 million (2.65-3.55) deaths, the majority of which were attributable to Omicron variants (98.5% [97.4-99.1] of infections, 82.6% [76.7-86.3] of hospitalisations, and 72.4% [66.4-76.0] of deaths). Compared to the pre-Omicron pandemic period from January 1, 2020, to November 15, 2021, we estimated that there were more than twice as many infections (214% [163-286]) globally from November 15, 2021, to December 12, 2022, but only 20.6% (19.8-21.4) of the estimated deaths. The massive Omicron waves and high vaccination rates in many high-income countries have together contributed to high levels of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, leaving only 97.3% (96.3-98.2) of the global population with no protection as of December 1, 2022. Concurrently, however, China, where only 17.6% [5.28-34.8] of the population have ever experienced infection due to its zero-COVID policy, requires special attention over the next few months, as all our future scenarios predict substantial increases in transmission, hospitalisation, and death in China in now that zero-COVID policies have been relaxed. Under the future scenario we consider most plausible (a scenario with another new Omicron-like variant emerging and reference levels of the drivers of transmission), we estimated there will be an additional 5.19 billion (3.11-7.78) infections, 13.6 million (8.50-21.8) hospitalisations, and 2.74 million (1.40-5.68) deaths between December 12, 2022, and June 30, 2023, with the Western Pacific region projected to sustain the highest rates of additional deaths, driven primarily by the uncontained outbreak in China. By comparison, a baseline scenario in which no new variant emerges results in 3.54 billion (2.24-5.43) infections, 6.26 million (4.11-9.65) hospitalisations, and 1.58 million (0.829-3.95) deaths in the same forecast period. The ability for a new variant to break through past infection- and vaccine-derived immunity greatly influences future outcomes: we estimate a new variant with the high severity of Delta, but correspondingly moderate immunity breakthrough rates will have difficulty overtaking current variants and will result in similar outcomes to the Omicron-like variant scenario with 3.64 billion (2.26-5.83) new infections, 7.87 million (4.81-13.0) new hospitalisations, and 2.87 million (1.03-5.56) new deaths. Finally, if we consider a variant that combines the high infectiousness and breakthrough rates of Omicron with the high severity of Delta, we again estimate 5.19 billion (3.11-7.78) new infections, but due to the presumed increase in severe outcomes, we estimate 30.2 million (13.4-51.2) new hospitalisations and 15.9 million (4.31-35.9) deaths over the forecasted period. The impacts of interventions vary by variant characteristics and region of the world, with increased mask usage and reimplementation of some mandates having massive impact in some regions while having less impact in others. Finally, assuming variant spread was as rapid as observed for Omicron, we find almost no impact of a rapidly developed and deployed variant-targeted booster.

InterpretationAs infection-derived and vaccine-conferred protection wanes, we expect infections to rise, but as most of the worlds population has some level of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as of December 12, 2022, all but the most pessimistic forecasts in this analysis do not predict a massive global surge by June 30, 2023. Paradoxically, China, due to its lower levels of population immunity and effective vaccination will likely experience substantial numbers of infections and deaths that, due to its large population size, will adversely affect the global toll. This could be substantially mitigated by existing intervention options including masking, vaccination, health-care preparedness, and effective antiviral compounds for those at most at risk of poor outcomes. While still resulting in morbidity and mortality, this endemic transmission provides protection from less transmissible variants and particularly protects against sub-lineages of the more severe pre-Omicron variants. In the scenarios where a new variant does emerge and spread globally, however, the speed of this spread may be too fast to rely on even the most quickly developed mRNA vaccines to provide protection soon enough. Existing vaccines and boosters have played an important role in increasing immunity worldwide, but the continued contribution of mask usage (both past and future) in the prevention of infection and death cannot be understated. The characteristics of future COVID-19 variants are inherently difficult to predict, and our forecasts do show considerable differences in outcomes as a function of these variant properties. Given the uncertainty surrounding what type of variant will next emerge, the world would be wise to remain vigilant in 2023 as we move to the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a plethora of COVID-19 models developed; most were designed to focus on a specific location (or small set of locations) and a short time horizon (usually less than a month). A number of modelling consortiums were created to develop ensemble predictions across models of this sort (e.g., the COVID-19 Forecast Hub [maintained by the Reich Lab of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in collaboration with USA CDC (Centers for Disease Control)] or the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub [created by a multitude of infectious disease modelling teams and coordinated by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)]), and the final results typically predicted four weeks, and at most, six weeks forward. The models combined for these ensembles ran the spectrum from transmission dynamic models that incorporated complex mixing patterns between individuals, to machine learning models that were agnostic of the fact that the input and output were associated with infectious diseases. Moreover, most of these models were designed to predict the most likely outcome as opposed to evaluate potential future scenarios. A small subset of these models were created with this sort of flexibility, though they have primarily been applied to limited global regions (e.g., USA CDC scenarios) and they typically do not evaluate multiple potential scenarios three to six months into the future. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) COVID-19 model has been generating and publishing forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths globally with four-month time horizons and making these available at mostly weekly intervals on its website since March 26, 2020 (https://covid19.healthdata.org). The cadence has now slowed to monthly updates as in many parts of the world, data needed to support the modelling of COVID-19 have reduced and/or ceased to be collected as the attention of policy makers and funders is drawn elsewhere. Several epidemiological scenarios have been evaluated in these online estimates, but the outcomes have not been formally compared across these scenarios globally into 2023. This article is also the first full formal documentation of the IHME-SEI model incorporating foundation work on infection-fatality ratio, more robust cumulative infection calculations, as well as more recently developed work that allows for waning immunity.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study is the first to forecast multiple future COVID-19 scenarios of variant emergence against a background of high rates of past SARS-CoV-2 exposure globally, nationally, and for a set of subnational locations, six months into the future. It is also one of the first to forecast the impact of China relaxing its zero-COVID policy. The scenarios considered were selected to represent a range of realistic potential futures and are directly comparable by region, country, and territory (and in many instances subnational units), to identify future risk as well as inform on the effectiveness of potential intervention strategies. In particular, we directly compared scenarios where a future variant is presumed to be similar to Omicron (high infectiousness, low severity, high immune-breakthrough), Delta (moderate infectiousness, high severity, moderate immune-breakthrough), a Delta with increased immune escape (moderate infectiousness, high severity, high immune-breakthrough), or the worst of both (high infectiousness, high severity, high immune-breakthrough) to a scenario where no new variant emerges. We then evaluated several interventions against each potential variant future, each in isolation and in concert. In addition to providing timely predictions for China as they remove restrictions, we provide insight into which locations may be at highest risk for future COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations, and deaths, and what they might do to mitigate the worst possible outcomes.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe Omicron waves have already resulted in an estimated 8.60 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6.37-11.7) infections in the past 13 months globally (from November 15, 2021, through December 12, 2022). Previous exposure to other variants and vaccination have together resulted in 97.3% (96.3-98.2) of the global population being estimated to have some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as of December 12, 2022. While infection- and vaccine-derived immunity has and will continue to wane, this protection and ongoing transmission of currently circulating variants will mitigate the scale of the next COVID-19 wave. The scale of mitigation possible is highly dependent on the characteristics of the next variant. To assess the potential for a COVID-19 surge in early 2023, we evaluated several future variant scenarios, as well as the unlikely baseline scenario of no new variant emerging. In the absence of any new variant, our baseline model predicts 1.58 million (0.829-3.95) deaths globally between December 12, 2022, and June 30, 2023. If a variant with similar characteristics to Omicron (eg, high infectiousness and low severity) emerges on January 15, 2023, our model predicts 2.74 million (1.40-5.68) additional deaths over the same period. A variant with the characteristics of Delta is predicted to have difficulty overtaking current variants and past immunity, and despite its substantial severity, our model predicts a number of deaths similar to an Omicron-like new variant (2.87 million [1.03-5.56]). In the worst-case scenario considered, a variant with the transmission and breakthrough characteristics of Omicron and the severity of Delta would result in 15.9 million (4.31-35.9) deaths, 14.3 million (3.33-32.7) more than a scenario where no new variant emerges. In China, the potential morbidity and mortality in 2023 is high, due to a combination of pandemic history and policy that has kept levels of population immunity to COVID-19 low. In our "worst case" variant scenario, we estimate initiatives to return mask use to 80% of the population (or the location-specific current level, if higher) as well as the reimplementation of moderate mandates would avert 32.8% (18.7-51.3) of the predicted deaths, with maximal impact occurring in the European region (44.8% [28.7-61.6]). In every variant scenario, given the estimated speed of global spread, we predict that variant-targeted mRNA boosters are not able to be deployed soon enough to have a substantial impact. While there is considerable uncertainty in the future of COVID-19 variant characteristics, this study demonstrates a range of plausible outcomes expected across a spectrum of future realities. Although it would require nations to react quickly to newly detected threats, our predictions show that increased mask use and (where necessary) reimplementation of moderate social distancing mandates can mitigate much of any future challenge.},

  TITLE = {Collaborative nowcasting of COVID-19 hospitalization incidences in Germany},
  ABSTRACT = {Real-time surveillance is a crucial element in the response to infectious disease outbreaks. However, the interpretation of incidence data is often hampered by delays occurring at various stages of data gathering and reporting. As a result, recent values are biased downward, which obscures current trends. Statistical nowcasting techniques can be employed to correct these biases, allowing for accurate characterization of recent developments and thus enhancing situational awareness. In this paper, we present a preregistered real-time assessment of eight nowcasting approaches, applied by independent research teams to German 7-day hospitalization incidences. This indicator played an important role in the management of the pandemic in Germany and was linked to levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions via certain thresholds. Due to its definition, in which hospitalization counts are aggregated by the date of case report rather than admission, German hospitalization incidences are particularly affected by delays and can take several weeks or months to fully stabilize. For this study, all methods were applied from 22 November 2021 to 29 April 2022, with probabilistic nowcasts produced each day for the current and 28 preceding days. Nowcasts at the national, state, and age-group levels were collected in the form of quantiles in a public repository and displayed in a dashboard. Moreover, a mean and a median ensemble nowcast were generated. We find that overall, the compared methods were able to remove a large part of the biases introduced by delays. Most participating teams underestimated the importance of very long delays, though, resulting in nowcasts with a slight downward bias. The accompanying uncertainty intervals were also too narrow for almost all methods. Averaged over all nowcast horizons, the best performance was achieved by a model using case incidences as a covariate and taking into account longer delays than the other approaches. For the most recent days, which are often considered the most relevant in practice, a mean ensemble of the submitted nowcasts performed best. We conclude by providing some lessons learned on the definition of nowcasting targets and practical challenges.},

  TITLE = {Retrospective evaluation of short-term forecast performance of ensemble sub-epidemic frameworks and other time-series models: The 2022-2023 mpox outbreak across multiple geographical scales, July 14th, 2022, through February 26th, 2023},
  ABSTRACT = {In May 2022, public health officials noted an unprecedented surge in mpox cases in non-endemic countries worldwide. As the epidemic accelerated, multi-model forecasts of the epidemics trajectory were critical in guiding the implementation of public health interventions and determining policy. As the case levels have significantly decreased as of early September 2022, evaluating model performance is essential to advance the growing field of epidemic forecasting.

Using laboratory-confirmed mpox case data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Our World in Data (OWID) teams through the week of January 26th, 2023, we generated retrospective sequential weekly forecasts (e.g., 1-4-weeks) for Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, the USA, and at the global scale using models that require minimal input data including the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), general additive model (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Facebooks Prophet model, as well as the sub-epidemic wave (spatial-wave) and n-sub-epidemic modeling frameworks. We assess forecast performance using average mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), weighted interval score (WIS), 95% prediction interval coverage (95% PI coverage), and skill scores. Average Winkler scores were used to calculate skill scores for 95% PI coverage.

Overall, the n-sub-epidemic modeling framework outcompeted other models across most locations and forecasting horizons, with the unweighted ensemble model performing best across all forecasting horizons for most locations regarding average MSE, MAE, WIS, and 95% PI coverage. However, many locations had multiple models performing equally well for the average 95% PI coverage. The n-sub-epidemic and spatial-wave frameworks improved considerably in average MSE, MAE, and WIS, and Winkler scores (95% PI coverage) relative to the ARIMA model. Findings lend further support to sub-epidemic frameworks for short-term forecasting epidemics of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

SummaryIn the face of many unknowns (i.e., transmission, symptomology) posed by the unprecedented 2022-2023 mpox epidemic, near real-time short-term forecasts of the epidemics trajectory were essential in intervention implementation and guiding policy. As case levels continue to dissipate, evaluating the modeling strategies used in producing real-time forecasts is critical to refine and grow the field of epidemiological forecasting. Here, we systematically evaluate the performance of an ensemble n-sub-epidemic and related sub-epidemic wave (spatial-wave) modeling frameworks against ARIMA, GAM, Prophet, and SLR models in producing sequential retrospective weekly (1-4 week) forecasts of mpox cases for the highest burdened countries (i.e., Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and on a global scale. Overall, the n-sub-epidemic framework outperformed all other models most frequently, followed closely in success by the spatial-wave framework, GAM, and ARIMA models regarding average MSE, MAE, and WIS metrics. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted model and spatial-wave framework performed best overall based on average 95% PI coverage, and we noted widespread success for both frameworks in average Winkler scores. The considerable success seen with both frameworks highlights the continued utility of sub-epidemic methodologies in producing short-term forecasts and their potential application to other epidemiologically different diseases.},

  TITLE = {Challenges of COVID-19 Case Forecasting in the US, 2020-2021},
  ABSTRACT = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting COVID-19 trends to support planning and response was a priority for scientists and decision makers alike. In the United States, COVID-19 forecasting was coordinated by a large group of universities, companies, and government entities led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org). We evaluated approximately 9.7 million forecasts of weekly state-level COVID-19 cases for predictions 1-4 weeks into the future submitted by 24 teams from August 2020 to December 2021. We assessed coverage of central prediction intervals and weighted interval scores (WIS), adjusting for missing forecasts relative to a baseline forecast, and used a Gaussian generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to evaluate differences in skill across epidemic phases that were defined by the effective reproduction number. Overall, we found high variation in skill across individual models, with ensemble-based forecasts outperforming other approaches. Forecast skill relative to the baseline was generally higher for larger jurisdictions (e.g., states compared to counties). Over time, forecasts generally performed worst in periods of rapid changes in reported cases (either in increasing or decreasing epidemic phases) with 95% prediction interval coverage dropping below 50% during the growth phases of the winter 2020, Delta, and Omicron waves. Ideally, case forecasts could serve as a leading indicator of changes in transmission dynamics. However, while most COVID-19 case forecasts outperformed a naive baseline model, even the most accurate case forecasts were unreliable in key phases. Further research could improve forecasts of leading indicators, like COVID-19 cases, by leveraging additional real-time data, addressing performance across phases, improving the characterization of forecast confidence, and ensuring that forecasts were coherent across spatial scales. In the meantime, it is critical for forecast users to appreciate current limitations and use a broad set of indicators to inform pandemic-related decision making.

Author SummaryAs SARS-CoV-2 began to spread throughout the world in early 2020, modelers played a critical role in predicting how the epidemic could take shape. Short-term forecasts of epidemic outcomes (for example, infections, cases, hospitalizations, or deaths) provided useful information to support pandemic planning, resource allocation, and intervention. Yet, infectious disease forecasting is still a nascent science, and the reliability of different types of forecasts is unclear. We retrospectively evaluated COVID-19 case forecasts, which were often unreliable. For example, forecasts did not anticipate the speed of increase in cases in early winter 2020. This analysis provides insights on specific problems that could be addressed in future research to improve forecasts and their use. Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of forecasts is critical to improving forecasting for current and future public health responses.},

  TITLE = {Informing pandemic response in the face of uncertainty. An evaluation of the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub},
  ABSTRACT = {Our ability to forecast epidemics more than a few weeks into the future is constrained by the complexity of disease systems, our limited ability to measure the current state of an epidemic, and uncertainties in how human action will affect transmission. Realistic longer-term projections (spanning more than a few weeks) may, however, be possible under defined scenarios that specify the future state of critical epidemic drivers, with the additional benefit that such scenarios can be used to anticipate the comparative effect of control measures. Since December 2020, the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) has convened multiple modeling teams to make 6-month ahead projections of the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The SMH released nearly 1.8 million national and state-level projections between February 2021 and November 2022. SMH performance varied widely as a function of both scenario validity and model calibration. Scenario assumptions were periodically invalidated by the arrival of unanticipated SARS-CoV-2 variants, but SMH still provided projections on average 22 weeks before changes in assumptions (such as virus transmissibility) invalidated scenarios and their corresponding projections. During these periods, before emergence of a novel variant, a linear opinion pool ensemble of contributed models was consistently more reliable than any single model, and projection interval coverage was near target levels for the most plausible scenarios (e.g., 79% coverage for 95% projection interval). SMH projections were used operationally to guide planning and policy at different stages of the pandemic, illustrating the value of the hub approach for long-term scenario projections.},

  TITLE = {Characterising information gains and losses when collecting multiple epidemic model outputs},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundCollaborative comparisons and combinations of epidemic models are used as policy-relevant evidence during epidemic outbreaks. In the process of collecting multiple model projections, such collaborations may gain or lose relevant information. Typically, modellers contribute a probabilistic summary at each time-step. We compared this to directly collecting simulated trajectories. We aimed to explore information on key epidemic quantities; ensemble uncertainty; and performance against data, investigating potential to continuously gain information from a single cross-sectional collection of model results.

MethodsWe compared July 2022 projections from the European COVID-19 Scenario Modelling Hub. Five modelling teams projected incidence in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain. We compared projections by incidence, peaks, and cumulative totals. We created a probabilistic ensemble drawn from all trajectories, and compared to ensembles from a median across each models quantiles, or a linear opinion pool. We measured the predictive accuracy of individual trajectories against observations, using this in a weighted ensemble. We repeated this sequentially against increasing weeks of observed data. We evaluated these ensembles to reflect performance with varying observed data.

ResultsBy collecting modelled trajectories, we showed policy-relevant epidemic characteristics. Trajectories contained a right-skewed distribution well represented by an ensemble of trajectories or a linear opinion pool, but not models quantile intervals. Ensembles weighted by performance typically retained the range of plausible incidence over time, and in some cases narrowed this by excluding some epidemic shapes.

ConclusionsWe observed several information gains from collecting modelled trajectories rather than quantile distributions, including potential for continuously updated information from a single model collection. The value of information gains and losses may vary with each collaborative efforts aims, depending on the needs of projection users. Understanding the differing information potential of methods to collect model projections can support the accuracy, sustainability, and communication of collaborative infectious disease modelling efforts.

  TITLE = {Predicting subnational incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in EU countries},
  ABSTRACT = {BackgroundRecurring COVID-19 waves highlight the need for tools able to quantify transmission risk, and identify geographical areas at risk of outbreaks. Local outbreak risk depends on complex immunity patterns resulting from previous infections, vaccination, waning and immune escape, alongside other factors (population density, social contact patterns). Immunity patterns are spatially and demographically heterogeneous, and are challenging to capture in country-level forecast models.

MethodsWe used a spatiotemporal regression model to forecast subnational case and death counts and applied it to three EU countries as test cases: France, Czechia, and Italy. Cases in local regions arise from importations or local transmission. Our model produces age-stratified forecasts given age-stratified data, and links reported case counts to routinely collected covariates (test number, vaccine coverage..). We assessed the predictive performance of our model up to four weeks ahead using proper scoring rules and compared it to the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model. Using simulations, we evaluated the impact of variations in transmission on the forecasts. We developed an open-source RShiny App to visualise the forecasts and scenarios.

ResultsAt a national level, the median relative difference between our median weekly case forecasts and the data up to four weeks ahead was 25% (IQR: 12-50%) over the prediction period. The accuracy decreased as the forecast horizon increased (on average 24% increase in the median ranked probability score per added week), while the accuracy of death forecasts remained stable. Beyond two weeks, the model generated a narrow range of likely transmission dynamics. The median national case forecasts showed similar accuracy to forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model, but the prediction interval was narrower in our model. Generating forecasts under alternative transmission scenarios was therefore key to capturing the range of possible short-term transmission dynamics.

DiscussionOur model captures changes in local COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, and enables quantification of short-term transmission risk at a subnational level. The outputs of the model improve our ability to identify areas where outbreaks are most likely, and are available to a wide range of public health professionals through the Shiny App we developed.},

  TITLE = {Potential impact of annual vaccination with reformulated COVID-19 vaccines: lessons from the U.S. COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub},
  ABSTRACT = {ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to cause significant hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups).

DesignThe COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario.

SettingThe entire United States.

ParticipantsNone.

ExposureAnnually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster.

Main outcomes and measuresEnsemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period.

ResultsFrom April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths.

Conclusion and RelevanceCOVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the likely impact of COVID-19 from April 2023-April 2025 and to what extent can vaccination reduce hospitalizations and deaths?

FindingsUnder plausible assumptions about viral evolution and waning immunity, COVID-19 will likely cause annual epidemics peaking in November-January over the two-year projection period. Though significant, hospitalizations and deaths are unlikely to reach levels seen in previous winters. The projected health impacts of COVID-19 are reduced by 10-20% through moderate use of reformulated vaccines.

MeaningCOVID-19 is projected to remain a significant public health threat. Annual vaccination can reduce morbidity, mortality, and strain on health systems.},

  TITLE = {Combining models to generate consensus medium-term projections of hospital admissions, occupancy and deaths relating to COVID-19 in England},
  ABSTRACT = {Mathematical modelling has played an important role in offering informed advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. In England, a cross government and academia collaboration generated Medium-Term Projections (MTPs) of possible epidemic trajectories over the future 4-6 weeks from a collection of epidemiological models.In this paper we outline this collaborative modelling approach and evaluate the accuracy of the combined and individual model projections against the data over the period November 2021-December 2022 when various Omicron subvariants were spreading across England. Using a number of statistical methods, we quantify the predictive performance of the model projections for both the combined and individual MTPs, by evaluating the point and probabilistic accuracy. Our results illustrate that the combined MTPs, produced from an ensemble of heterogeneous epidemiological models, were a closer fit to the data than the individual models during the periods of epidemic growth or decline, with the 90% confidence intervals widest around the epidemic peaks. We also show that the combined MTPs increase the robustness and reduce the biases associated with a single model projection. Learning from our experience of ensemble modelling during the COVID-19 epidemic, our findings highlight the importance of developing cross-institutional multi-model infectious disease hubs for future outbreak control.},

  TITLE = {Evaluation of FluSight influenza forecasting in the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons with a new target laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations},
  ABSTRACT = {Accurate forecasts can enable more effective public health responses during seasonal influenza epidemics. Forecasting teams were asked to provide national and jurisdiction-specific probabilistic predictions of weekly confirmed influenza hospital admissions for one through four weeks ahead for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 influenza seasons.

Across both seasons, 26 teams submitted forecasts, with the submitting teams varying between seasons. Forecast skill was evaluated using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), relative WIS, and coverage.

Six out of 23 models outperformed the baseline model across forecast weeks and locations in 2021-22 and 12 out of 18 models in 2022-23. Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble was the 2nd most accurate model measured by WIS in 2021-22 and the 5th most accurate in the 2022-23 season. Forecast skill and 95% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degraded over longer forecast horizons and during periods of rapid change.

Current influenza forecasting efforts help inform situational awareness, but research is needed to address limitations, including decreased performance during periods of changing epidemic dynamics.},

  TITLE = {A dynamic ensemble model for short-term forecasting in pandemic situations},
  ABSTRACT = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals reached their capacity limits and could no longer guarantee treatment of all patients. At the same time, governments endeavored to take sensible measures to stop the spread of the virus while at the same time trying to keep the economy afloat. Many models extrapolating confirmed cases and hospitalization rate over short periods of time have been proposed, including several ones coming from the field of machine learning. However, the highly dynamic nature of the pandemic with rapidly introduced interventions and new circulating variants imposed non-trivial challenges for the generalizability of such models.

In the context of this paper, we propose the use of ensemble models, which are allowed to change in their composition or weighting of base models over time and can thus adapt to highly dynamic pandemic or epidemic situations. In that regard, we also explored the use of secondary metadata - Google searches - to inform the ensemble model. We tested our approach using surveillance data from COVID-19, Influenza, and hospital syndromic surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). In general, we found ensembles to be more robust than the individual models. Altogether we see our work as a contribution to enhance the preparedness for future pandemic situations.},

  TITLE = {Forecasting the spatial spread of an Ebola epidemic in real-time: comparing predictions of mathematical models and experts},
  ABSTRACT = {Ebola virus disease outbreaks can often be controlled, but require rapid response efforts frequently with profound operational complexities. Mathematical models can be used to support response planning, but it is unclear if models improve the prior understanding of experts.

We performed repeated surveys of Ebola response experts during an outbreak. From each expert we elicited the probability of cases exceeding four thresholds between two and 20 cases in a set of small geographical areas in the following calendar month. We compared the predictive performance of these forecasts to those of two mathematical models with different spatial interaction components.

An ensemble combining the forecasts of all experts performed similarly to the two models. Experts showed stronger bias than models forecasting two-case threshold exceedance. Experts and models both performed better when predicting exceedance of higher thresholds. The models also tended to be better at risk-ranking areas than experts.

Our results support the use of models in outbreak contexts, offering a convenient and scalable route to a quantified situational awareness, which can provide confidence in or to call into question existing advice of experts. There could be value in combining expert opinion and modelled forecasts to support the response to future outbreaks.},

  TITLE = {An adaptive weight ensemble approach to forecast influenza activity in the context of irregular seasonality},
  ABSTRACT = {Forecasting of influenza activity in tropical and subtropical regions such as Hong Kong is challenging due to irregular seasonality with high variability in the onset of influenza epidemics, and potential summer activity. To overcome this challenge, we develop a diverse set of statistical, machine learning and deep learning approaches to forecast influenza activity in Hong Kong 0-to 8- week ahead, leveraging a unique multi-year surveillance record spanning 34 winter and summer epidemics from 1998-2019. We develop a simple average ensemble (SAE), which is the average of individual forecasts from the top three individual models. We also consider an adaptive weight blending ensemble (AWBE) that allows for dynamic updates of each model contribution based on LASSO regression and uses decaying weights in historical data to capture rapid change in influenza activity. Overall, across all 9 weeks of horizon, all models outperform the baseline constant incidence model, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 23%-29% and weighted interval score (WIS) by 25%-31%. The SAE ensemble only slightly better than individual models, reducing RMSE and WIS by 29%. The AWBE ensemble reduce RMSE by 45% and WIS by 46%, and outperform individual models for forecasts of epidemic trends (growing, flat, descending), and during both winter and summer seasons. Using the post-COVID surveillance data in 2023-2024 as another test period, the AWBE ensemble still reduces RMSE by 32% and WIS by 36%. Our framework contributes to the ensemble forecasting of infectious diseases with irregular seasonality.

Significance statementIn subtropical and tropical regions, irregular influenza seasonality makes accurate forecasting challenging. We test ensemble approaches using diverse statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models based on a unique multi-year surveillance record in Hong Kong. Performance of individual models varies by season and epidemic trend, but simple averaging ensemble cannot improve accuracy. Here we develop an adaptive weight ensemble approach, which updated individual model contributions dynamically. This approach halves the RMSE, outperforms all individual models in different settings and reducing RMSE by one-third even in post-COVID periods. Our method contributes to comparison and benchmarking of models in ensemble forecasts, enhancing the evidence base for synthesizing multiple models in disease forecasting in geographies with irregular influenza seasonality.},
