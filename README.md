# Multi-model ensembles for infectious disease forecasting: A systematic review

- [Full protocol registration](https://osf.io/84zhn)

## Background

### Rationale

Infectious disease modelling is a useful tool for supporting outbreak control, offering to interpret the complex uncertainty of epidemiological dynamics. Modellers handle this uncertainty with a variety of approaches, choices, and interpretations during modelling work. Working in collaboration offers comparability across this diversity of modelling work. Modelling collaborations may aim to enable expert elicitation among modellers, clarify the extent and policy relevance of uncertainty, or provide a synthesis of modelling evidence (1–4). Specifically, collaboration among multiple independent and diverse modelling teams may create a stronger basis for evidence-informed policy support (5,6).

Outputs from such modelling collaborations often include a quantitative combination of numerical model results into an ensemble projection. A key benefit of model combination is the increased predictive accuracy of the combined result (7,8). Such findings underlie ensemble approaches in, for example, economics, logistics, or meteorology (9). This better performance partly comes from the independent information added by each projection, while reducing the variance in uncertainty across projections. Meanwhile, the unreliability of individual model performance may mean that there is no obvious best way to combine projections beyond a simple linear average (the “forecast combination puzzle” (10)). These results appear to hold in infectious disease settings, even with an increasing number and range of approaches and methods for model combination (e.g. (11–13)). 

This review aims to summarise existing evidence on the predictive accuracy of multi-model ensemble projections of infectious disease (forecasts). As a secondary aim, this review will capture some of the benefits and challenges involved in such collaborations among modellers. This will draw together an increasing literature analysing multi-model collaborations, and support their future design, communication, and evaluation.

### Objectives

To assess the accuracy and value of multi-model ensembles for forecasting infectious disease outbreaks.

RQ1: What is the predictive performance of multi-model ensemble projections from independent models in comparison to individual component models when forecasting infectious disease?

RQ2: What are the benefits and challenges of such multi-model ensembles?
